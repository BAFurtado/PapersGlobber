Although QSP models are becoming essential in discovering predictive biomarkers and developing combination therapies through\r\n              in silico\r\n              virtual trials, they are inadequate to capture the spatial heterogeneity and randomness that characterize complex biological systems, and specifically the tumor microenvironment. Here, we extend our recently developed spatial QSP (spQSP) model to analyze tumor growth dynamics and its response to immunotherapy at different spatio-temporal scales. In the model, the tumor spatial dynamics is governed by the ABM, coupled to the QSP model, which includes the following compartments: central (blood system), tumor, tumor-draining lymph node, and peripheral (the rest of the organs and tissues). A dynamic recruitment of T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) from the QSP central compartment has been implemented as a function of the spatial distribution of cancer cells. The proposed QSP-ABM coupling methodology enables the spQSP model to perform as a coarse-grained model at the whole-tumor scale and as an agent-based model at the regions of interest (ROIs) scale. Thus, we exploit the spQSP model potential to characterize tumor growth, identify T cell hotspots, and perform qualitative and quantitative descriptions of cell density profiles at the invasive front of the tumor. Additionally, we analyze the effects of immunotherapy at both whole-tumor and ROI scales under different tumor growth and immune response conditions. A digital pathology computational analysis of triple-negative breast cancer specimens is used as a guide for modeling the immuno-architecture of the invasive front.", "language": "en", "ISSN":

Broadly speaking, ring vaccination rivaled mass vaccination if a very substantial proportion of smallpox cases could be detected and isolated almost immediately after infection, or if residual herd immunity in the population was relatively high.  Pre-attack mass vaccination and post-attack mass vaccination were equivalent in their capacities to eliminate the virus from the population within five months, but the pre-attack strategy did so with significantly fewer deaths in the process.

We also consider impact of environmental regulation and industry clusters in this process. Using agent-based modeling, we construct a computational experimental simulation model for the adoption of green development behavior by construction enterprises. The model considers the organizational behavior characteristics of construction enterprises and the evolutionary characteristics of the renewable construction materials market. Our results show that in terms of renewable building materials, construction enterprises that actively adopt green development behavior are more sustainable than those that do not. Moreover, with the implementation of sustainable environmental regulations, more enterprises are passively adopting green development behaviors. However, unsustainable environmental regulations do not have a positive effect. The formation of industrial clusters is also conducive to promoting companies\u2019 adoption of green development behaviors. Therefore, construction enterprises should take the initiative to adopt green development behavior and migrate to industrial agglomerations. This practice is not only beneficial to the sustainable operation of the enterprise and the expansion of the enterprise scale, it will also have an optimization effect on the external environment.

Individual decisions, such as where to go on vacation, influence the state of the destination as well as local and global transportation flows, and these feedbacks are often non-linear. Simultaneously, tourism and its ecosystem are changing through their interactions. ABM can capture heterogeneities in agent characteristics, types, and decisions as well as variations in the environmental context, providing it with the potential to assist researchers in understanding complex tourism challenges, explore potential future scenarios, and support decision-making. In this chapter, tourism as a complex system and the relevance of ABM for studying such emerging challenges will be described. In the practical demonstration, the main steps for developing an agent-based model will also be explained, and the model Coasting will illustrate the process of model building, key components of the model, and analysis tools.", "ISBN": "9783030883898", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-88389-8_23", "extra": "DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-88389-8_23", "bookTitle": "Applied Data Science in

As a complex social-ecological system, water demands in the Sonoran Desert from agricultural and urban users often conflicts with water needs for its ecologically-significant riparian corridors. To explore this system, we developed an agent-based model to simulate complex feedbacks between human decisions and environmental conditions in the Rio Sonora Watershed. Cognitive mapping in conjunction with stakeholder participation produced a Bayesian model of conditional probabilities of local human decision-making processes resulting to changes in water demand. Probabilities created in the Bayesian model were incorporated into the agent-based model, so that each agent had a unique probability to make a positive decision based on its perceived environment at each point in time and space. By using a Bayesian approach, uncertainty in the human decision-making process could be incorporated. The spatially-explicit agent-based model simulated changes in depth-to-groundwater by well pumping based on an agent's water demand. Changes in depth-to-groundwater feedback to influence agent behavior, as well as determine unique vegetation classes within the riparian corridor. Each vegetation class then provides varying stakeholder-defined quality values of ecosystem services. Using this modeling approach allowed us to examine effects on both the ecological and social system of semi-arid riparian corridors under various scenarios.

Similarly to the actual spread of the disease, the dynamics of the contention patterns emerging from the application of NPIs are complex and depend on interactions between people within a specific region as well as other stochastic factors associated to demographic, geographic, political and economical conditions. Agent-based models simulate microscopic rules of simultaneous spatial interactions between multiple agents within a population, in an attempt to reproduce the complex dynamics of the effect of the contention measures. In this way, it is possible to design individual behaviours along with NPI scenarios, measuring how the simulation dynamics is affected and therefore, yielding rapid insights to perform a broad assessment of the potential of composite interventions at different stages of the epidemic. In this paper we describe a model and a tool to experiment with such kind of analysis applied to a conceptual city, considering a number of widely-applied NPIs such as social distancing, case isolation, home quarantine, total lockdown, sentinel testing, mask wearing and a distinctive \u201czonal\u201d enforcement measure, requiring these interventions to be applied gradually to separated enclosed districts (zones). We find that the model is able to capture emerging dynamics associated to these NPIs; besides, the zonal contention strategy yields an improvement on the mitigation impact across all scenarios of combination with individual NPIs. The model and tool are open to extensions to account for omitted or newer factors affecting the planning and design of NPIs intended to counter the late stages or forthcoming waves of the COVID-19 crisis.", "language": "en", "url": "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.13.20130542v1", "pages": "2020.06.13.20130542", "libraryCatalog": "medRxiv", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:34:34Z", "extra": "Type: article"}, {"key": "RAIBQUUJ", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Derek T.", "lastName": "Robinson", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Daniel G.", "lastName": "Brown", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Dawn C.", "lastName": "Parker", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Pepijn", "lastName": "Schreinemachers", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Marco A.", "lastName": "Janssen", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Marco", "lastName": "Huigen", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Heidi", "lastName": "Wittmer", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Nick", "lastName": "Gotts", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Panomsak", "lastName": "Promburom", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Elena", "lastName": "Irwin", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Thomas", "lastName": "Berger", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Franz", "lastName": "Gatzweiler", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "C\u00e9cile", "lastName": "Barnaud", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Journal of Land Use Science", "journalAbbreviation": "Journal of Land Use Science", "volume": "2", "issue": "1", "language": "en", "ISSN": "1747-423X, 1747-4248", "date": "2007-04-02", "pages": "31-55", "DOI": "10.1080/17474230701201349", "url": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17474230701201349", "title": "Comparison of empirical methods for building agent-based models in land use science", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:34:36Z"}, {"key": "XSXJIC4Z", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Scott", "lastName": "de Marchi", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Scott E.", "lastName": "Page", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Annual Review of Political Science", "journalAbbreviation": "Annu.

We present the framework CppyABM that unifies these features by providing identical ABM semantic and development styles in both C++ and Python as well as the essential binding tools to expose a certain functionality from C++ to Python. The binding feature allows users to tailor and further extend a type or function within Python while it is originally defined in C++. Using CppyABM, users can choose either C++ or Python depending on their expertise and the specialty of the model or combine them to benefit from the advantages of both languages simultaneously. We provide showcases of CppyABM capabilities using several examples in computational biology, ecology, and virology. These examples are implemented in different formats using either C++ or Python or a combination of both to provide a comparison between the performance of implementation scenarios.

Addressing the dilemma will require an enhancement in the throughput capacity of the expression and evaluation of mechanistic hypotheses. Doing so will require the ability to place biomedical knowledge into a format where hypotheses can be readily instantiated such that the dynamics inherent to biological systems can be represented, and also technological enhancement of the generation of such dynamic models. We suggest that the former goal can be approached by using the meta\u2010structure of agent\u2010based models (ABMs) to integrate different knowledge hierarchies currently represented with bio\u2010ontologies and increase the expressiveness of formal knowledge representation to account for mechanistic biological rules. The development of an agent\u2010based modeling format (ABMF) will provide a bridge between ontological knowledge representation and methods for modeling and simulation (M&S). We further suggest that the latter goal of process enhancement can be targeted by the development of intelligent computational agents that can concatenate bio\u2010ontologies with M&S ontologies to semiautomate the generation of bio\u2010simulations. We believe that the application of these two complementary approaches would address the foundational nature of the current throughput bottleneck in the scientific cycle.\r\n              WIREs Comp Stat\r\n              2011 3 343\u2013356 DOI: 10.1002/wics.167\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              This article is categorized under:\r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  Statistical Models > Agent-Based Models\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  Applications of Computational Statistics > Computational and Molecular Biology\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  Software for Computational Statistics > Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  Statistical Models > Simulation Models", "language": "en", "ISSN": "1939-5108, 1939-0068", "date": "07/2011", "pages": "343-356", "DOI": "10.1002/wics.167", "url": "https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wics.167", "title": "Agent\u2010based modeling and biomedical ontologies: a roadmap", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:35:28Z", "shortTitle": "Agent\u2010based modeling and biomedical ontologies"}, {"key": "D4EF3XZ6", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Eric", "lastName": "Silverman", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Umberto", "lastName": "Gostoli", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Stefano", "lastName": "Picascia", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Jonatan", "lastName": "Almagor", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Mark", "lastName": "McCann", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Richard", "lastName": "Shaw", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Claudio", "lastName": "Angione", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Emerging Themes in Epidemiology", "journalAbbreviation": "Emerg Themes Epidemiol", "volume": "18", "issue": "1", "abstractNote": "Abstract\r\n            Today\u2019s most troublesome population health challenges are often driven by social and environmental determinants, which are difficult to model using traditional epidemiological methods.

ABM is capable of explicitly modeling these individuals and the interactions among them, which facilitates the discovery of system behavior that cannot be observed using other methods.

These systems have several components that include agents having options, boundaries, self-organising behaviour, different options from which to choose, feedback to adapt, and an emergent behaviour.

It is intended to support tactical decision-making around localized/staged re-institution of pre-pandemic levels and patterns of social/economic/health service delivery activity, following an initial stage of pan-societal closures of social/economic institutions and broad-based reductions in services.\nBy design, CovidSIMVL supports the generation of dynamic models that reflect heterogeneity within and between a network of interacting localized contexts. This heterogeneity is embodied in a hierarchically organized set of rules. Primary rules reflect the pathophysiology of transmission. Secondary rules (\u201cHazardRadius\u201d and \u201cMingle Factor\u201d in CovidSIMVL) relate transmission to proximity and movement within physically demarcated and relatively contained spaces (\u201cUniverses\u201d). Tertiary rules (\u201cSchedules\u201d) relate probabilities of transmission to movement of people between a network of localized contexts (a CovidSIMVL \u201cMultiverse\u201d).\nThis report focuses mainly on calibration of secondary rules. To calibrate the HazardRadius and MingleFactor parameters, growth curves were generated with CovidSIMVL by setting different configurations of values on those two proximal determinants of viral transmission. These were compared to the characteristic shapes of curves generated by equation-based compartmental models (e.g., SEIR models) that fit different real-world datasets embodying different reproduction numbers (R0).\nBy operating with parameter values in CovidSIMVL that generate \u201creal-world\u201d growth curves, the tool can be used to produce plausible simulations of localized chains of transmission. These include transmission among different groups of persons (e.g., staff, patients) who are co-located within a single setting such as a long-term care facility. The Multiverse version of CovidSIMVL can be used to simulate localized cross-over transmission among arrays consisting of both unaffected and impacted contexts and associated sub-populations, via agents who interact within and across arrays of contexts such as schools, multigenerational families, recreational facilities, places of work, emergency shelters for homeless persons, or other settings in which people are in close physical proximity.", "language": "en", "url": "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.01.20217943v1", "pages": "2020.11.01.20217943", "libraryCatalog": "medRxiv", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:36:17Z", "extra": "Type: article"}, {"key": "HN9K6VF5", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "J.", "lastName": "Gary Polhill", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Alessandro", "lastName": "Gimona", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Richard J.", "lastName": "Aspinall", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Journal of Land Use Science", "journalAbbreviation": "Journal of Land Use Science", "volume": "6", "issue": "2-3", "language": "en", "ISSN": "1747-423X, 1747-4248", "date": "06/2011", "pages": "75-81", "DOI": "10.1080/1747423X.2011.558603", "url": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1747423X.2011.558603", "title": "Agent-based modelling of land use effects on ecosystem processes and services", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:36:19Z"}, {"key": "48SZDVLD", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Emilie", "lastName": "Lindkvist", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Nanda", "lastName": "Wijermans", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Tim M.", "lastName": "Daw", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Blanca", "lastName": "Gonzalez-Mon", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Alfredo", "lastName": "Giron-Nava", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Andrew F.", "lastName": "Johnson", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Ingrid", "lastName": "van Putten", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Xavier", "lastName": "Basurto", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Maja", "lastName": "Schl\u00fcter", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "title": "Navigating Complexities: Agent-Based Modeling to Support Research, Governance, and Management in Small-Scale Fisheries", "url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2019.00733", "ISSN": "2296-7745", "volume": "6", "abstractNote": "The sustainable governance and management of small-scale fisheries (SSF) is challenging, largely due to their dynamic and complex nature. Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a computational modeling approach that can account for the dynamism and complexity in SSF by modeling entities as individual agents with different characteristics and behavior, and simulate how their interactions can give rise to emergent phenomena, such as over-fishing and social inequalities. The structurally realistic design of agent-based models allow stakeholders, experts, and scientists across disciplines and sectors to reconcile different knowledge bases, assumptions, and goals. ABMs can also be designed using any combination of theory, quantitative data, or qualitative data. In this publication we elaborate on the untapped potential of ABM to tackle governance and management challenges in SSF, discuss the limitations of ABM, and review its application in published SSF models. Our review shows that, although few models exist to date, ABM has been used for diverse purposes, including as a research tool for understanding cooperation and over-harvesting, and as a decision-support tool, or participatory tool, in case-specific fisheries. Even though the development of ABMs is often time- and resource intensive, it is the only dynamic modeling approach that can represent entities of different types, their heterogeneity, actions, and interactions, thus doing justice to the complex and dynamic nature of SSF which, if ignored can lead to unintended policy outcomes and less sustainable SSF.", "date": "2020", "publicationTitle": "Frontiers in Marine Science", "libraryCatalog": "Frontiers", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:36:22Z", "shortTitle": "Navigating Complexities"}, {"key": "UWFHWLRK", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Hui-Han", "lastName": "Chen", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Andrew", "lastName": "Stringer", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Tadesse", "lastName": "Eguale", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Gauri G.", "lastName": "Rao", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Sachiko", "lastName": "Ozawa", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene", "volume": "101", "issue": "5", "language": "en", "ISSN": "0002-9637, 1476-1645", "date": "2019-11-06", "pages": "1042-1053", "DOI": "10.4269/ajtmh.18-0930", "url": "https://ajtmh.org/doi/10.4269/ajtmh.18-0930", "title": "Impact of Antibiotic Resistance on Treatment of Pneumococcal Disease in Ethiopia: An Agent-Based Modeling Simulation", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:36:26Z", "shortTitle": "Impact of Antibiotic Resistance on Treatment of Pneumococcal Disease in Ethiopia"}, {"key": "A5AZLGY7", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Antonino", "lastName": "Marvuglia", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Alper", "lastName": "Bayram", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Paul", "lastName": "Baustert", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Tom\u00e1s Navarrete", "lastName": "Guti\u00e9rrez", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Elorri", "lastName": "Igos", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Journal of Cleaner Production", "journalAbbreviation": "Journal of Cleaner Production", "volume": "332", "language": "en", "ISSN": "09596526", "date": "01/2022", "pages": "129847", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129847", "url": "https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959652621040208", "title": "Agent-based modelling to simulate farmers\u2019 sustainable decisions: Farmers\u2019 interaction and resulting green consciousness evolution", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:36:28Z", "shortTitle": "Agent-based modelling to simulate farmers\u2019 sustainable decisions"}, {"key": "LN5ACLNA", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Sebastian", "lastName": "Poledna", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Michael Gregor", "lastName": "Miess", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Cars", "lastName": "Hommes", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Katrin", "lastName": "Rabitsch", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "European Economic Review", "journalAbbreviation": "European Economic Review", "volume": "151", "language": "en", "ISSN": "00142921", "date": "01/2023", "pages": "104306", "DOI": "10.1016/j.euroecorev.2022.104306", "url": "https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014292122001891", "title": "Economic forecasting with an agent-based model", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:36:32Z"}, {"key": "FLR3VJZN", "version": 0, "itemType": "report", "creators": [{"firstName": "Nicolas", "lastName": "Hoertel", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Martin", "lastName": "Blachier", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Carlos", "lastName": "Blanco", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Mark", "lastName": "Olfson", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Marc", "lastName": "Massetti", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", "lastName": "Limosin", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Henri", "lastName": "Leleu", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "reportType": "preprint", "institution": "Public and Global Health", "date": "2020-04-28", "abstractNote": "Abstract\r\n          Global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created an unprecedented infectious disease crisis worldwide. Despite uncertainties about COVID-19, model-based forecasting of competing mitigation measures on its course is urgently needed to inform mitigation policy. We used a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model of the COVID-19 epidemic in New York City and evaluated the potential impact of quarantine duration (from 4 to 16 weeks), quarantine lifting type (1-step lifting for all individuals versus a 2-step lifting according to age), post-quarantine screening, and use of a hypothetical effective treatment against COVID-19 on the disease\u2019s cumulative incidence and mortality, and on ICU-bed occupancy. The source code of the model has been deposited in a public source code repository (GitHub\u00ae). The model calibrated well and variation of model parameter values had little impact on outcome estimates. While quarantine is efficient to contain the viral spread, it is unlikely to prevent a rebound of the epidemic once lifted. We projected that lifting quarantine in a single step for the full population would be unlikely to substantially lower the cumulative mortality, regardless of quarantine duration. By contrast, a two-step quarantine lifting according to age was associated with a substantially lower cumulative mortality and incidence, up to 71% and 23%, respectively, as well as lower ICU-bed occupancy. Although post-quarantine screening was associated with diminished epidemic rebound, this strategy may not prevent ICUs from being overcrowded. It may even become deleterious after a 2-step quarantine lifting according to age if the herd immunity effect does not had sufficient time to become established in the younger population when the quarantine is lifted for the older population. An effective treatment against COVID-19 would considerably reduce the consequences of the epidemic, even more so if ICU capacity is not exceeded.", "language": "en", "extra": "DOI: 10.1101/2020.04.23.20076885", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.04.23.20076885", "title": "Facing the COVID-19 epidemic in NYC: a stochastic agent-based model of various intervention strategies", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:36:36Z", "shortTitle": "Facing the COVID-19 epidemic in NYC"}, {"key": "IRSS2IT2", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Andrea", "lastName": "Ceschi", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Riccardo", "lastName": "Sartori", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Stephan", "lastName": "Dickert", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Andrea", "lastName": "Scalco", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Elena M.", "lastName": "Tur", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Francesco", "lastName": "Tommasi", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Keren", "lastName": "Delfini", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Journal of Environmental Management", "journalAbbreviation": "Journal of Environmental Management", "volume": "294", "language": "en", "ISSN": "03014797", "date": "09/2021", "pages": "112938", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112938", "url": "https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0301479721010008", "title": "Testing a norm-based policy for waste management: An agent-based modeling simulation on nudging recycling behavior", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:36:38Z", "shortTitle": "Testing a norm-based policy for waste management"}, {"key": "7RYZKYC4", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Jens Koed", "lastName": "Madsen", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Toby D.", "lastName": "Pilditch", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Asim", "lastName": "Zia", "creatorType": "editor"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "PLOS ONE", "journalAbbreviation": "PLoS ONE", "volume": "13", "issue": "4", "language": "en", "ISSN": "1932-6203", "date": "2018-4-10", "pages": "e0193909", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0193909", "url": "https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0193909", "title": "A method for evaluating cognitively informed micro-targeted campaign strategies: An agent-based model proof of principle", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:36:40Z", "shortTitle": "A method for evaluating cognitively informed micro-targeted campaign strategies"}, {"key": "6QADQP38", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "David J.", "lastName": "Blok", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Frank J.", "lastName": "van Lenthe", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Sake J.", "lastName": "de Vlas", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity", "journalAbbreviation": "Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act", "volume": "15", "issue": "1", "language": "en", "ISSN": "1479-5868", "date": "12/2018", "pages": "107", "DOI": "10.1186/s12966-018-0740-y", "url": "https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-018-0740-y", "title": "The impact of individual and environmental interventions on income inequalities in sports participation: explorations with an agent-based model", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:36:43Z", "shortTitle": "The impact of individual and environmental interventions on income inequalities in sports participation"}, {"key": "JIKDN4TB", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "In\u00eas", "lastName": "Boavida-Portugal", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Carlos Cardoso", "lastName": "Ferreira", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Jorge", "lastName": "Rocha", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Current Issues in Tourism", "journalAbbreviation": "Current Issues in Tourism", "volume": "20", "issue": "15", "language": "en", "ISSN": "1368-3500, 1747-7603", "date": "2017-11-18", "pages": "1557-1574", "DOI": "10.1080/13683500.2015.1041880", "url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13683500.2015.1041880", "title": "Where to vacation?

These approaches may be particularly appropriate for social epidemiology. Social network analysis and agent-based models (ABMs) are two approaches that have been used in the epidemiologic literature. Social network analysis involves the characterization of social networks to yield inference about how network structures may influence risk exposures among those in the network. ABMs can promote population-level inference from explicitly programmed, micro-level rules in simulated populations over time and space. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of these models in social epidemiologic research, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Network analysis may be ideal for understanding social contagion, as well as the influences of social interaction on population health. However, network analysis requires network data, which may sacrifice generalizability, and causal inference from current network analytic methods is limited. ABMs are uniquely suited for the assessment of health determinants at multiple levels of influence that may couple with social interaction to produce population health. ABMs allow for the exploration of feedback and reciprocity between exposures and outcomes in the etiology of complex diseases. They may also provide the opportunity for counterfactual simulation. However, appropriate implementation of ABMs requires a balance between mechanistic rigor and model parsimony, and the precision of output from complex models is limited.

It provided two results: (1) a network of arguments around vegetarian diets is modelled using an abstract argumentation approach. Each argument, formalized by a node, was connected with other arguments by arrows, thus formalizing relationships between arguments. This methodology made it possible to formalize an argument network about vegetarian diets and to identify the importance of health arguments compared to ethical or other types of arguments. This methodology also identified key arguments as a result of their high centrality in being challenged or challenging other arguments. The results of constructing this argument network suggested that any controversy surrounding vegetarian diets will be polarized around such high centrality arguments about health. Even though few ethical arguments appeared in our network, the health arguments concerning the necessity or not of animal products for humans were indirectly connected with ethical choices towards vegetarian diets; (2) an agent-based simulation of the social diffusion of opinions and practices concerning meat consumption is then introduced.

These topics need to be explored if evaluation is to move beyond using complex adaptive systems in an exclusively heuristic fashion.   \u00a0  Purpose: This paper advocates for the integration of agent based modeling into traditional evaluation activities. We advance this position in order to spark a movement toward incorporating the formal application of complex adaptive systems into the theory and methods of evaluation. To make our case, we provide a hypothetical example of how interactions between an agent-based model and evaluation can provide unique and powerful understanding about the adoption of evidence-based practices in the field of addiction treatment. We advance our argument by addressing four questions: Why combine evaluation methods with simulation methods? Why use a complex adaptive systems approach? Why add agent-based modeling to the mix of evaluation tools?

Selecting mitigation actions to protect public health may be difficult, as contamination is a poorly predictable dynamic event. Consumers who become aware of an event may select protective actions to change their water demands from typical demand patterns, and new hydraulic conditions can arise that differ from conditions that would be predicted when demands are considered as exogenous inputs. Consequently, the movement of the contaminant plume in the pipe network may shift from its expected trajectory. A sociotechnical model is developed here to integrate agent-based models of consumers with an engineering water distribution system model and capture the dynamics between consumer behaviors and the water distribution system for predicting contaminant transport and public exposure.

As consumers decrease their water use, the location of the contaminant plume is updated and the amount of contaminant consumed by each agent is calculated.

Nearly 40% of the world's population relies on open fires and rudimentary cooking devices exacerbating health outcomes, deforestation, and climatic impacts of inefficient biomass burning. Clean technology alternatives such as clean cookstoves are among the most challenging technologies to approach their target goals through sustainable adoption due to a lack of systematic market-driven design for adoption. Thus, a method is needed to provide insight regarding how target customers evaluate and perceive causes for adopting a clean technology. The holistic approach of this study captures technology adoption through lenses of social networks, individual and society scale beliefs, and rational decision-making behavior. Based on the data collected in the Apac region in Northern Uganda, an agent-based model is developed to simulate emerging adoption behavior in a community. Then, four different scenarios investigate how adoption patterns change due to the potential changes in technology or intervention strategy. These scenarios include influence of stove malfunctions, price elasticity, information campaigns, and strength of a social network. Results suggest that higher adoption rates are achievable if designed technologies are more durable, information campaigns provide realistic expectations for users, policymakers, and education programs work toward women's empowerment, and communal social ties are recognized for influence maximization. The application of this study provides insight for technology designers, project implementers, and policymakers to update their practices for achieving sustainable and to the scale clean technology adoption rates.", "language": "en", "ISSN": "1050-0472, 1528-9001", "date": "2021-02-01", "pages": "021402", "DOI": "10.1115/1.4047901", "url": "https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/mechanicaldesign/article/143/2/021402/1085678/An-Agent-Based-Model-for-Adoption-of-Clean", "title": "An Agent-Based Model for Adoption of Clean Technology Using the Theory of Planned Behavior", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:37:28Z"}, {"key": "3P7TN5Q8", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "M.

In particular, caring for children and for vulnerable older people is vital to the wellbeing of millions of families throughout the world. In most developed countries, this care is provided through both formal and informal means, and is therefore governed by complex policies that interact in non-obvious ways with other areas of policy-making. In this paper we present an agent-based model of social and child care provision in the UK, in which agents can provide informal care or pay for private care for their relatives. Agents make care decisions based on numerous factors including their health status, employment, financial situation, and social and physical distance to those in need. Simulation results show that the model can produce plausible patterns of care need and availability, and therefore can provide an important aid to this complex area of policy-making. We conclude that the model\u2019s use of kinship networks for distributing care and the explicit modelling of interactions between social care and child care will enable policy-makers to develop more informed policy interventions in these critical areas.\r\n            \r\n              \u201cThe moral test of government is how it treats those who are in the dawn of life\r\n              ,\r\n              the children\r\n              ;\r\n              those who are in the twilight of life\r\n              ,\r\n              the aged\r\n              ;\r\n              and those in the shadows of life, the sick\r\n              ,\r\n              the needy and the handicapped\r\n              .\r\n              \u201d\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \u2014 Hubert Humphrey Jr\r\n              .", "language": "en", "ISSN": "1932-6203", "date": "2020-12-2", "pages": "e0242779", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0242779", "url": "https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242779", "title": "Social and child care provision in kinship networks: An agent-based model", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:37:38Z", "shortTitle": "Social and child care provision in kinship networks"}, {"key": "7U3TQADY", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "C.", "lastName": "Searle", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "J.H.", "lastName": "van Vuuren", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Computers, Environment and Urban Systems", "journalAbbreviation": "Computers, Environment and Urban Systems", "volume": "85", "language": "en", "ISSN": "01989715", "date": "01/2021", "pages": "101568", "DOI": "10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101568", "url": "https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S019897152030301X", "title": "Modelling forced migration: A framework for conflict-induced forced migration modelling according to an agent-based approach", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:37:41Z", "shortTitle": "Modelling forced migration"}, {"key": "2XGBHMW8", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Caterina", "lastName": "Caprioli", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Marta", "lastName": "Bottero", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Elena", "lastName": "De Angelis", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Computers, Environment and Urban Systems", "journalAbbreviation": "Computers, Environment and Urban Systems", "volume": "102", "language": "en", "ISSN": "01989715", "date": "06/2023", "pages": "101955", "DOI": "10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2023.101955", "url": "https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0198971523000182", "title": "Combining an agent-based model, hedonic pricing and multicriteria analysis to model green gentrification dynamics", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:37:44Z"}, {"key": "F4CP2LAY", "version": 0, "itemType": "bookSection", "creators": [{"firstName": "Lishan", "lastName": "Kang", "creatorType": "editor"}, {"firstName": "Zhihua", "lastName": "Cai", "creatorType": "editor"}, {"firstName": "Xuesong", "lastName": "Yan", "creatorType": "editor"}, {"firstName": "Yong", "lastName": "Liu", "creatorType": "editor"}, {"firstName": "Dan", "lastName": "Guo", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Bo", "lastName": "Ren", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Cheng", "lastName": "Wang", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "bookTitle": "Advances in Computation and Intelligence", "place": "Berlin, Heidelberg", "ISBN": "9783540921363 9783540921370", "publisher": "Springer Berlin Heidelberg", "volume": "5370", "date": "2008", "pages": "618-625", "extra": "DOI: 10.1007/978-3-540-92137-0_68", "url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-540-92137-0_68", "title": "Integrated Agent-Based Modeling with GIS for Large Scale Emergency Simulation", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:37:53Z"}, {"key": "SUEQICQ8", "version": 0, "itemType": "conferencePaper", "creators": [{"firstName": "Erika", "lastName": "Frydenlund", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Peter", "lastName": "Foytik", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Jose J.", "lastName": "Padilla", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Alain", "lastName": "Ouattara", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "proceedingsTitle": "2018 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)", "place": "Gothenburg, Sweden", "conferenceName": "2018 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)", "ISBN": "9781538665725", "publisher": "IEEE", "date": "12/2018", "pages": "22-32", "DOI": "10.1109/WSC.2018.8632555", "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8632555/", "title": "WHERE ARE THEY HEADED NEXT?

The model uses the 2007 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) to create a virtual population that mimics the joint distribution of demographic characteristics and health behavior in the Los Angeles County. We calibrated the outcome of hypertension as a function of individual age and fruits/vegetable consumption, based upon the observed pattern in the survey. We then simulated an intervention scenario to promote healthier eating by increasing the visibility (i.e. descriptive social norms) of those who eat at least one serving of fruits/vegetable per day. We compare the hypertension incidence under the status quo scenario and the intervention scenario. We found that the effect size of 5% in social norm enhancement yields a reduction in 5 year hypertension incidence by 10.08%. An effect size of 15% would reduce incidence by 15.50%. In conclusion, the agent-based model built and calibrated around real-world data shows that changes descriptive social norms in healthy eating can be effective to reduce the burden of hypertension.

While expert knowledge on climate change percolates through political initiatives and public awareness, its translation into large-scale policy actions appears limited. Climate change consequences unequally target regions, countries and social classes, a vital issue for social cooperation. When facing an imminent ecological collapse, in which conditions can self-interested agents gain environmental awareness and settle on a sustainable path of actions when their knowledge of the imminent collapse is bounded? This cooperation emerges from the interaction between individuals and the interaction of various cognitive processes within individuals. This article develops an agent-based model for this emergence of cooperation enriched with the Agent Zero neurocognitive grounded cognitive architecture. We investigate when agents endowed with deliberative, affective and social modules can settle on actions that safeguard their environment through numerical simulations. Our results show that cooperation on sustainable actions is the strongest when the system is at the edge of collapse. Policy measures that increase the environment\u2019s resilience become internalized by the agents and undermine awareness of the ecological catastrophe. Depending on the cognitive channels activated, agent behaviors and reactions to specific interventions significantly vary.

Clinical trial design cannot fully capture the impact of information diffusion, which can act as a force multiplier for the intervention. Furthermore, experimentation is needed to understand how intervention delivery can optimize social spread under varying circumstances. To study information diffusion from CRx under varying conditions, we built an agent-based model (ABM).

To build the ABM, we constructed a synthetic population (\u201cagents\u201d) using publicly-available data sources.

Using RepastHPC and chiSIM software, we replicated the intervention\r\n              in silico\r\n              , simulated information diffusion processes, and generated emergent information diffusion networks.

Community resource information spread via social dosing was nearly 4 fold that from clinical dosing alone and did not vary by delivery mode. This study, using CRx as an example, demonstrates the process of building and experimenting with an ABM to study information diffusion from, and the population-level impact of, a clinical information-based intervention.

Agent-based modeling is used to create a network model of preferential attachment to explore how phenomena of minority opinion spreading can evolve under different simulated scenarios.

We developed a preliminary agent-based simulation model designed to examine agent\u2013environment interactions that support the development and maintenance of drinking behavior at the population level.\r\n            Methods. The model was defined on a 1-dimensional lattice along which agents might move left or right in single steps at each iteration. Agents could exchange information about their drinking with each other. In the second generation of the model, a \u201cbar\u201d was added to the lattice to attract drinkers.\r\n            Results. The model showed that changes in drinking status propagated through the agent population as a function of probabilities of conversion, rates of contact, and contact time. There was a critical speed of population mixing beyond which the conversion rate of susceptible nondrinkers was saturated, and the bar both enhanced and buffered the rate of propagation, changing the model dynamics.\r\n            Conclusions.

With the advancement of urban land-use change theories and modeling techniques, a considerable number of models have been developed. The relatively young approach, agent-based modeling, provides urban land-use models with some new features and can help address the challenges faced by traditional models. Applications of agent-based models to study urban dynamics have increased steadily over the last twenty years. To offer a retrospective on the developments in agent-based models (ABMs) of urban residential choices, we review fifty-one relevant models that fall into three general categories: (i) urban land-use models based on classical theories; (ii) different stages of the urbanization process; and (iii) integrated agent-based and microsimulation models. We summarize and compare the main features of these fifty-one models within each category. This review focuses on three fundamental new features introduced byABMs. The first is agent heterogeneity with particular attention to the method of introducing heterogeneity in agents' attributes and behaviors. The second is the representation of land-market processes, namely preferences, resources constraints, competitive bidding, and endogenous relocation. The third is the method of measuring the extensive model outputs. In addition, we outline accompanying challenges to, and open questions for, incorporating these new features. We conclude that, by modeling agent heterogeneity and land markets, and by exploiting a much broader dimension of output, we will enhance our understanding of urban land-use change and are hopefully able to improve model fitness and robustness.", "language": "en", "ISSN": "0265-8135, 1472-3417", "date": "08/2014", "pages": "661-689", "DOI": "10.1068/b120043p", "url":

Hence, it is crucial to assess the health impact, cost-effectiveness, and social distributional impacts of possible urban exposome interventions (UEIs) before implementing them. Spatial agent-based modeling (ABM) can capture complex behavior\u2013environment interactions, exposure dynamics, and social outcomes in a spatial context. This article discusses model architectures and methodological challenges for successfully modeling UEIs using spatial ABM. We review the potential and limitations of the method; model components required to capture active and passive exposure and intervention effects; human\u2013environment interactions and their integration into the macro-level health impact assessment and social costs benefit analysis; and strategies for model calibration. Major challenges for a successful application of ABM to UEI assessment are (1) the design of realistic behavioral models that can capture different types of exposure and that respond to urban interventions, (2) the mismatch between the possible granularity of exposure estimates and the evidence for corresponding exposure\u2013response functions, (3) the scalability issues that emerge when aiming to estimate long-term effects such as health and social impacts based on high-resolution models of human\u2013environment interactions, (4) as well as the data- and computational complexity of calibrating the resulting agent-based model. Although challenges exist, strategies are proposed to improve the implementation of ABM in exposome research.", "language": "en", "ISSN": "2635-2265", "date": "2022-03-12", "pages": "osac009", "DOI": "10.1093/exposome/osac009", "url": "https://academic.oup.com/exposome/article/doi/10.1093/exposome/osac009/6754814", "title": "Agent-based modeling of urban exposome interventions: prospects, model architectures, and methodological challenges", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:40:11Z", "shortTitle": "Agent-based modeling of urban exposome interventions"}, {"key": "6G76GU8Y", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Patrycja", "lastName": "Antosz", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Sukaina", "lastName": "Bharwani", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Melania", "lastName": "Borit", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Bruce", "lastName": "Edmonds", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "International Journal of Social Research Methodology", "journalAbbreviation": "International Journal of Social Research Methodology", "volume": "25", "issue": "4", "language": "en", "ISSN": "1364-5579, 1464-5300", "date": "2022-07-04", "pages": "511-515", "DOI": "10.1080/13645579.2022.2052651", "url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13645579.2022.2052651", "title": "An introduction to the themed section on \u2018 <i>Using agent-based simulation for integrating qualitative and quantitative evidence</i> \u2019", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:40:13Z"}, {"key": "LLVTSHXZ", "version": 0, "itemType": "bookSection", "creators": [{"firstName": "Andrew T.", "lastName": "Crooks", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Alison J.", "lastName": "Heppenstall", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Alison J.", "lastName": "Heppenstall", "creatorType": "editor"}, {"firstName": "Andrew T.", "lastName": "Crooks", "creatorType": "editor"}, {"firstName": "Linda M.", "lastName": "See", "creatorType": "editor"}, {"firstName": "Michael", "lastName": "Batty", "creatorType": "editor"}], "tags": [{"tag": "Geographical Information System", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Cellular Automaton", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Cellular Automaton", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Agent Interaction", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Cellular Automaton Model", "type": 1}], "date": "2012", "title": "Introduction to Agent-Based Modelling", "pages": "85-105", "publisher": "Springer Netherlands", "abstractNote": "The application of agent-based modelling (ABM) to simulating dynamics within geographical systems has seen a considerable increase over the last decade.

Many CoPs across broad disciplines have turned to community frameworks for complexity modeling (CFCMs) but this strategy has been slow to be discussed let alone adopted by the social sciences communities of practice (SS-CoPs). \n\tIn this paper we urge the SS-CoPs that it is timely to develop and establish a CBCF for the social sciences for two major reasons: the rapid acquisition of data and the emergence of critical cybertools which can facilitate agent-based, spatially-explicit models. The goal of this paper is not to prescribe how a CFCM might be set up but to suggest of what components it might consist and what its advantages would be. Agent based models serve the establishment of a CFCM because they allow robust and diverse inputs and are amenable to output-driven modifications. In other words, as phenomena are resolved by a SS-CoP it is possible to adjust and refine ABMs (and their predictive ability) as a recursive and collective process. Existing and emerging cybertools such as computer networks, digital data collections and advances in programming languages mean the SS-CoP must now carefully consider committing the human organization to enabling a cyberinfrastructure tool. The combination of technologies with human interfaces can allow scenarios to be incorporated through 'if' 'then' rules and provide a  powerful basis for addressing the dynamics of coupled and complex social ecological systems (cSESs). The need for social scientists to be more engaged participants in the growing challenges of characterizing chaotic, self-organizing social systems and predicting emergent patterns makes the application of ABMs timely. The enabling of a SS-CoP CFCM human-cyberinfrastructure represents an unprecedented opportunity to synthesize, compare and evaluate diverse sociological phenomena as a cohesive and recursive community-driven process.", "websiteType": "Text.Article", "language": "en", "url": "https://www.jasss.org/9/4/6.html", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:41:06Z", "shortTitle": "An \"All Hands\" Call to the Social Science Community"}, {"key": "CHTIY8JX", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Milan", "lastName": "Lovri\u0107", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Ting", "lastName": "Li", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Peter", "lastName": "Vervest", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Decision Support Systems", "journalAbbreviation": "Decision Support Systems", "volume": "54", "issue": "4", "language": "en", "ISSN": "01679236", "date": "3/2013", "pages": "1587-1601", "DOI": "10.1016/j.dss.2012.05.061", "url": "https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167923612001820", "title": "Sustainable revenue management: A smart card enabled agent-based modeling approach", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:41:09Z", "shortTitle": "Sustainable revenue management"}, {"key": "4X6IDQKK", "version": 0, "itemType": "conferencePaper", "creators": [], "tags": [], "proceedingsTitle": "Spring Simulation Conference (SpringSim 2020)", "place": "Fairfax, VA, USA", "conferenceName": "2020 Spring Simulation Conference", "ISBN": "9781713812883", "publisher": "Society for Modeling and Simulation International (SCS)", "date": "2020", "DOI": "10.22360/SpringSim.2020.HSAA.010", "url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3408207.3408260", "title": "Creating Perceptual Uncertainty in Agent-based Models with Social Interactions", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:41:12Z"}, {"key": "GKZ2BY9G", "version": 0, "itemType": "conferencePaper", "creators": [{"firstName": "Zhenghui", "lastName": "Sha", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Qize", "lastName": "Le", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Jitesh H.", "lastName": "Panchal", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "proceedingsTitle": "Volume 2: 31st Computers and Information in Engineering Conference, Parts A and B", "place": "Washington, DC, USA", "conferenceName": "ASME 2011 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference", "abstractNote": "Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a technique used to simulate systems consisting of autonomous interacting entities called agents.

Further, the currently available tools capture both the model information and the tool-specific execution information in an integrated manner. This limits model reusability, which is an impediment to systematic validation of models. In this paper, we use the systems modeling language (SysML) for building conceptual models of agent-based models. We discuss how the different diagrams in the SysML language can be used to represent different aspects of agent-based models. Further, we propose an approach for automatically generating executable agent-based models from their conceptual SysML representations.

By this, the study contributes to the development of ABMs in two main aspects: (1) Building on an existing concept of knowledge representation, we advance the model of individual and collective knowledge creation in firms by conceptualizing policy intervention and corresponding output indicators. (2) We go beyond symbolic ABMs of knowledge creation by using patent data as knowledge representations, adopting an elaborate empirical initialisation and calibration strategy using company data. We utilise econometric techniques to generate an industry-specific fitness function that determines the model output. The model allows for analysing the effect of different public research funding schemes on the technology profile of the Austrian biotechnology innovation system.

Therefore, this review aims to better understand the use of ABM for flood risk management and assessment (FRMA). The review comprises a systematic selection of literature using the PRISMA method, which is then assessed using an adapted version of the overview, design, and detail (ODD) protocol to better understand the ABM model development process for FRMA. The review finds that the use of the ODD protocol was only seen in 25% of the studies. The studies which did not explicitly use the ODD had a comprehensive description of the models, albeit done in a non-standardised way. Modellers continue to face the dilemma between parsimony and the breadth of the model as identified from the design component of the ODD. The hydrological component is mainly captured in the sub-model process of the ODD, however, improvements in the definition of the sub-model component may warrant a more comprehensive description of the processes and facilitate comparison across studies. The applications of ABM have shown promise to understand long term flood risks, test the efficacy of policies and better understand the factors that affect warning response during the flood evacuation process.

Microsimulation is closely linked conceptually to another type of individual-level modelling: agent-based models (ABM).

Set in the context of COVID-19 shelter in place policies, in this paper we present the COVID-19 Policy Evaluation (CoPE) tool, which is an agent-based modeling framework that enables researchers and policymakers to anticipate the relative impacts of policy decisions. Specifically, this framework illuminates the extent to which policy design features and behavioral responsiveness influence the efficacy and equity of policy responses to shock events. We show that while an early policy response can be highly effective, the impact of the timing is moderated by other aspects of policy design such as duration and targeting of the policy, as well as societal aspects such as trust and compliance among the population. More importantly, we show that even policies that are more effective overall can have disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations. By disaggregating the impact of different policy design elements on different population groups, we provide an additional tool for policymakers to use in the design of targeted strategies for disproportionately affected populations.", "language": "en", "ISSN": "1932-6203", "date": "2022-1-21", "pages": "e0262172", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0262172", "url":

Still, the danger of further waves of infections is omnipresent, and it is apparent that every containment policy must be carefully evaluated and possibly replaced by a different, less restrictive policy before it can be lifted. Tracing of contacts and consequential breaking of infection chains is a promising strategy to help contain the disease, although its precise impact on the epidemic is unknown.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Objective\r\n              In this work, we aim to quantify the impact of tracing on the containment of the disease and investigate the dynamic effects involved.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Design\r\n              We developed an agent-based model that validly depicts the spread of the disease and allows for exploratory analysis of containment policies. We applied this model to quantify the impact of different approaches of contact tracing in Austria to derive general conclusions on contract tracing.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Results\r\n              The study displays that strict tracing complements other intervention strategies. For the containment of the disease, the number of secondary infections must be reduced by about 75%. Implementing the proposed tracing strategy supplements measures worth about 5%. Evaluation of the number of preventively quarantined persons shows that household quarantine is the most effective in terms of avoided cases per quarantined person.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Limitations\r\n              The results are limited by the validity of the modeling assumptions, model parameter estimates, and the quality of the parametrization data.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Conclusions\r\n              The study shows that tracing is indeed an efficient measure to keep case numbers low but comes at a high price if the disease is not well contained.

Currently, research groups around the globe are trying to figure out such transmission dynamics under special conditions such as separation policies enforced by governments. Mathematical and computational models, like the compartmental model or the agent-based model, are being used for this purpose. This paper proposes an agent-based model, called INFEKTA, for simulating the transmission of infectious diseases, not only the COVID-19, under social distancing policies. INFEKTA combines the transmission dynamic of a specific disease, (according to parameters found in the literature) with demographic information (population density, age, and genre of individuals) of geopolitical regions of the real town or city under study. Agents (virtual persons) can move, according to its mobility routines and the enforced social distancing policy, on a complex network of accessible places defined over an Euclidean space representing the town or city. The transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 under different social distancing policies in Bogot\u00e1 city, the capital of Colombia, is simulated using INFEKTA with one million virtual persons. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of social distancing policies indicates that it is possible to establish a \u2018medium\u2019 (i.e., close 40% of the places) social distancing policy to achieve a significant reduction in the disease transmission.", "language": "en", "ISSN": "1932-6203", "date": "2021-2-19", "pages": "e0245787", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0245787", "url": "https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245787", "title": "INFEKTA\u2014An agent-based model for transmission of infectious diseases: The COVID-19 case in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:44:06Z", "shortTitle": "INFEKTA\u2014An agent-based model for transmission of infectious diseases"}, {"key": "3CEYC4A5", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Ben", "lastName": "Vermeulen", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Matthias", "lastName": "M\u00fcller", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Andreas", "lastName": "Pyka", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "title": "Social Network Metric-Based Interventions?

System dynamics models (SDM) and agent-based models (ABM) are two popular complementary methods, used to simulate macro- and micro-level health system behaviour. This systematic review aims to collate, compare and summarise the application of both methods in this field and to identify common healthcare settings and problems that have been modelled using SDM and ABM.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Methods\r\n              We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, MathSciNet, ACM Digital Library, HMIC, Econlit and Global Health databases to identify literature for this review.

Drawing on human geography and the sociospatial perspective in urban sociology, a framework that enables richer and more realistic representation of urban neighborhoods in agent-based simulation models is proposed and outlined. The framework relies on a graph representation of the spatial relations among spatial locations and can accommodate welldefined administrative zones, vague or ill-defined neighborhoods, hierarchically nested spatial zoning systems, overlapping neighborhoods, and changing relations among neighborhoods.

Modeling CASs is challenging for a variety of reasons including the presence of heterogeneity, spatial relationships, nonlinearity, and, of course, adaptation. The challenges of modeling CASs can largely be overcome by using the individual-level focus of agent-based modeling. Agent-based modeling has been used successfully to model CASs in many disciplines. Many of these models were implemented using agent-based modeling software such as Swarm, Repast 3, Repast Simphony, Repast for High-Performance Computing, MASON, NetLogo, or StarLogo. All of these options use modular imperative architectures with factored agents, spaces, a scheduler, logs, and an interface. Many custom agent-based models also use this kind of architecture. This paper\u2019s contribution is to introduce and apply a theoretical formalism for analyzing modular imperative agent-based models of CASs.

Modular imperative agent-based models are shown to be universal models, subject to the correctness of the Church-Turing thesis. Several other results are also proven about the time and space performance of modular imperative agent-based models. The formalism is then used to predict the performance of three models and the results are found to compare closely to the measured performance.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Conclusions\r\n              This paper\u2019s contribution is to introduce, analyze, and apply a theoretical formalism for proving findings about agent-based models with modular agent scheduler architectures.

Agent-based models use computer simulations that incorporate heterogeneity in individual behaviors and interactions, allow emergence of systemic behaviors, and extrapolate into the future. The Levers of HIV model (LHM) uses Chicago neighborhood demographics, data on sex-risk behaviors and sexual networks, and data on the prevention and care cascades, to model local dynamics. It models the impact of changes in local preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral treatment (ART) (ie, levers) for meeting Illinois\u2019 goal of \u201cGetting to Zero\u201d (GTZ) \u2014reducing by 90% new HIV infections among men who have sex with men (MSM) by 2030. We simulate a 15-year period (2016-2030) for 2304 distinct scenarios based on 6 levers related to HIV treatment and prevention: (1) linkage to PrEP for those testing negative, (2) linkage to ART for those living with HIV, (3) adherence to PrEP, (4) viral suppression by means of ART, (5) PrEP retention, and (6) ART retention. Using tree-based methods, we identify the best scenarios at achieving a 90% HIV infection reduction by 2030. The optimal scenario consisted of the highest levels of ART retention and PrEP adherence, next to highest levels of PrEP retention, and moderate levels of PrEP linkage, achieved 90% reduction by 2030 in 58% of simulations. We used Bayesian posterior predictive distributions based on our simulated results to determine the likelihood of attaining 90% HIV infection reduction using the most recent Chicago Department of Public Health surveillance data and found that projections of the current rate of decline (2016-2019) would not achieve the 90% (p = 0.0006) reduction target for 2030. Our results suggest that increases are needed at all steps of the PrEP cascade, combined with increases in retention in HIV care, to approach 90% reduction in new HIV diagnoses by 2030.

Food supply chains may have to become more efficient to meet the increasing food requirement of 10 Billion people by 2050. At the same time, food and nutrition security are at risk from increasingly likely shocks like extreme climate events, market shocks, pandemics, changing consumer preferences, and price volatility. Here we consider some possibilities and limitations regarding the improvement of resilience (the capacity to deal with shocks) and efficiency (here interpreted as the share of produced food delivered to consumers) of food supply chains. We employ an Agent Based Model of a generic food chain network consisting of stylized individuals representing producers, traders, and consumers. We do this: 1/ to describe the dynamically changing disaggregated flows of crop items between these agents, and 2/ to be able to explicitly consider agent behaviour. The agents have implicit personal objectives for trading. We quantify resilience and efficiency by linking these to the fraction of fulfilment of the overall explicit objective to have all consumers meet their food requirement. We consider different types of network structures in combination with different agent interaction types under different types of stylized shocks. We find that generally the network structures with higher efficiency are also more sensitive to shocks, while less efficient network types display more resilience. At first glance these results seem to confirm the existence of a system-level trade-off between resilience and efficiency similar to what is reported in business management and ecology literature. However, the results are modified by the trading interactions and the type of shock. In our simulations resilience and efficiency are affected by \u2018soft\u2019 boundaries caused by the preference and trust of agents (i.e., social aspects) in trading. The ability of agents to switch between trading partners represents an important aspect of resilience, namely a capacity to reorganize.

The statistical inference of the propagation of a disease by means of ensemble-based data assimilation systems has been studied in previous works. The models used are mostly compartmental models representing the mean field evolution through ordinary differential equations. These techniques allow to monitor the propagation of the infections from data and to estimate several parameters of epidemiological interest. However, there are many important features which are based on the individual interactions that cannot be represented in the mean field equations, such as social network and bubbles, contact tracing, isolating individuals in risk, and social network-based distancing strategies. Agent-based models can describe contact networks at an individual level, including demographic attributes such as age, neighborhood, household, workplaces, schools, entertainment places, among others. Nevertheless, these models have several unknown parameters which are thus difficult to prescribe. In this work, we propose the use of ensemble-based data assimilation techniques to calibrate an agent-based model using daily epidemiological data. This raises the challenge of having to adapt the agent populations to incorporate the information provided by the coarse-grained data. To do this, two stochastic strategies to correct the model predictions are developed. The ensemble Kalman filter with perturbed observations is used for the joint estimation of the state and some key epidemiological parameters.

In this paper, we present a tool for understanding the complex relationship between water and public health in rural areas of a developing country.

The model was calibrated using empirical data and published sources. It was used to simulate the effects of poor water quality on the frequency of diarrheal episodes in children, and consequently on child development. Preliminary simulation results show that at the current total coliform levels in the water sources of the studied villages, children are expected to experience stunting by as much as \u22121.0 standard deviations from the World Health Organization height norms. With minor modifications, the calibrated ABM can be used to design and evaluate intervention strategies for improving child health in these villages. The model can also be applied to other regions worldwide that face the same environmental challenges and conditions as the studied villages.", "extra": "PMID: 25530709\nPMCID: PMC4269164", "title": "Development of a Spatial and Temporal Agent-Based Model for Studying Water and Health Relationships: The Case Study of Two Villages in Limpopo, South Africa", "volume": "16", "issue": "4", "pages": "3", "date": "2013", "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4269164/", "libraryCatalog": "PubMed Central", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:47:07Z", "shortTitle": "Development of a Spatial and Temporal Agent-Based Model for Studying Water and Health Relationships"}, {"key": "RHEKSJBY", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Xiaolin", "lastName": "Hu", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Nicholas", "lastName": "Keller", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "title": "Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation of Child Maltreatment and Child Maltreatment Prevention", "publicationTitle": "Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation", "journalAbbreviation": "JASSS", "ISSN": "1460-7425", "date": "2015", "volume": "18", "issue": "3", "pages": "6"}, {"key": "IVG555DZ", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "A.

Currently, research groups around the globe are trying to figure out such transmission dynamics using different scientific and technological approaches. One of those is by using mathematical and computational models like the compartmental model or the agent-based models. In this paper, a general agent-based model, called INFEKTA, that combines the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease with agents (individuals) that can move on a complex network of accessible places defined over a Euclidean space representing a real town or city is proposed.

Agent\u2010based modeling is well suited to translating into a computational model the knowledge generated from basic science research, particularly with respect to translating across scales the mechanisms of cellular behavior into aggregated cell population dynamics manifesting at the tissue and organ level. This capacity has made agent\u2010based modeling an integral method in translational systems biology (TSB), an approach that uses multiscale dynamic computational modeling to explicitly represent disease processes in a clinically relevant fashion. The initial work in the early 2000s using agent\u2010based models (ABMs) in TSB focused on examining acute inflammation and its intersection with wound healing; the decade since has seen vast growth in both the application of agent\u2010based modeling to a wide array of disease processes as well as methodological advancements in the use and analysis of ABM. This report presents an update on an earlier review of ABMs in TSB and presents examples of exciting progress in the modeling of various organs and diseases that involve inflammation. This review also describes developments that integrate the use of ABMs with cutting\u2010edge technologies such as high\u2010performance computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, with a view toward the future integration of these methodologies.\r\n            \r\n              This article is categorized under:\r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  Translational, Genomic, and Systems Medicine > Translational Medicine\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  Models of Systems Properties and Processes > Mechanistic Models\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  Models of Systems Properties and Processes > Organ, Tissue, and Physiological Models\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  Models of Systems Properties and Processes > Organismal Models", "language": "en", "ISSN": "1939-5094, 1939-005X", "date": "11/2019", "pages": "e1460", "DOI": "10.1002/wsbm.1460", "url": "https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wsbm.1460", "title": "Agent\u2010based models of inflammation in translational systems biology: A decade later", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:47:31Z", "shortTitle": "Agent\u2010based models of inflammation in translational systems biology"}, {"key": "BLZC7FPK", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Navid", "lastName": "Nickdoost", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Hiba", "lastName": "Jalloul", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Juyeong", "lastName": "Choi", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction", "journalAbbreviation": "International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction", "volume": "80", "language": "en", "ISSN": "22124209", "date": "10/2022", "pages": "103215", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.103215", "url": "https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2212420922004344", "title": "An integrated framework for temporary disaster debris management sites selection and debris collection logistics planning using geographic information systems and agent-based modeling", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:47:38Z"}, {"key": "JN8J6UC2", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "David", "lastName": "Anzola", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Pete", "lastName": "Barbrook-Johnson", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Nigel", "lastName": "Gilbert", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "title": "The Ethics of Agent-Based Social Simulation", "publicationTitle": "Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation", "journalAbbreviation": "JASSS", "ISSN": "1460-7425", "date": "2022", "volume": "25", "issue": "4", "pages": "1"}, {"key": "DSMT2MM8", "version": 0, "itemType": "bookSection", "creators": [{"firstName": "Alex", "lastName": "Schwartz", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "title": "Agent-based modeling for legal studies", "date": "2020/09/17", "ISBN": "9781788977456", "url": "https://www.elgaronline.com/display/edcoll/9781788977449/9781788977449.00019.xml", "abstractNote": "This chapter provides an overview and illustration of agent-based modeling, a computational method for building \u201cbottom up\u201d simulations to investigate how the actions and interactions of individual autonomous units (or \u201cagents\u201d) generate systemic effects.

a major contributor to the global-burden of disease, and global-level health impact models suggest that climate change-mediated reductions in food quantity and quality will negatively affect it. These models, however, capture just some of the processes that will shape future nutrition. We adopt an alternative standpoint, developing an agent-based model in which producer-consumer smallholders practice different \u2018styles of farming\u2019 in the global food system. The model represents a hypothetical rural community in which \u2018orphan\u2019 (subsistence) farmers may develop by adopting an \u2018entrepreneurial\u2019 style (highly market-dependent) or by maintaining a \u2018peasant\u2019 style (agroecology). We take a first look at the question: how might patterns of farming styles\u2014under various style preference, climate, policy, and price transmission scenarios\u2014impact on hunger and health-supporting conditions (incomes, work, inequality, \u2018real land productivity\u2019) in rural areas? imulations without climate change or agricultural policy found that style preference patterns influence production, food price, and incomes, and there were trade-offs between them. For instance, entrepreneurial-oriented futures had the highest production and lowest prices but were simultaneously those in which farms tended towards crisis. Simulations with climate change and agricultural policy found that peasant-orientated agroecology futures had the highest production, prices equal to or lower than those under entrepreneurial-oriented futures, and better supported rural health. There were, however, contradictory effects on nutrition, with benefits and harms for different groups. Collectively the findings suggest that when attempting to understand how climate change may impact on future nutrition and health, patterns of farming styles\u2014along with the fates of the households that practice them\u2014matter. These issues, including the potential role of peasant farming, have been neglected in previous global-level climate-nutrition modelling but go to the heart of current debates on the future of farming: thus, they should be given more prominence in future work.", "language": "en", "ISSN": "1932-6203", "date": "2021-2-11", "pages": "e0246788", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0246788", "url":

These models offer an insightful alternative to the traditional techniques of mathematical modelling. Understanding how different designs of agent-based models change simulation outcomes will be useful for modellers of economic and other simulation scenarios. The work presented here examines how a computer simulation of an agent-based model responds to disruptive events, in the context of an economic model. Agents within the model interact by producing, selling and buying goods. A series of experiments compare system stability in two scenarios: one where a top-down rule is applied to the pricing of goods and another where decision-making is at the individual agent level, a bottom-up approach. These two approaches are termed system-adaptive and self-adaptive. Results draw the conclusion that a self-adaptive function can provide greater stability, but this depends on whether the measured variable is a primary or secondary variable to the adaptive function. Considerations are presented for future work which could consider the impact adaptive functions have on secondary variable measurements.", "language": "en", "ISSN": "1059-7123, 1741-2633", "date": "02/2023", "pages": "21-34", "DOI": "10.1177/10597123221095644", "url": "http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10597123221095644", "title": "Adaptive functions in an agent-based model of an economic system", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:49:14Z"}, {"key": "Y56VLJ3D", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Yan", "lastName": "Li", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Donglan", "lastName": "Zhang", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Janani R.", "lastName": "Thapa", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Kumbirai", "lastName": "Madondo", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Stella", "lastName": "Yi", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Elisa", "lastName": "Fisher", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Kerry", "lastName": "Griffin", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Bian", "lastName": "Liu", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Youfa", "lastName": "Wang", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Jos\u00e9 A.", "lastName": "Pag\u00e1n", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Preventive Medicine", "journalAbbreviation": "Preventive Medicine", "volume": "106", "language": "en", "ISSN": "00917435", "date": "01/2018", "pages": "73-78", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ypmed.2017.10.014", "url": "https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S009174351730364X", "title": "Assessing the role of access and price on the consumption of fruits and vegetables across New York City using agent-based modeling", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:49:17Z"}, {"key": "2NVJENT9", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Juan M.", "lastName": "S\u00e1nchez", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Juan P.", "lastName": "Rodr\u00edguez", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Helbert E.", "lastName": "Espitia", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Heliyon", "journalAbbreviation": "Heliyon", "volume": "8", "issue": "12", "language": "en", "ISSN": "24058440", "date": "12/2022", "pages": "e12005", "DOI": "10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e12005", "url": "https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2405844022032935", "title": "Bibliometric analysis of publications discussing the use of the artificial intelligence technique agent-based models in sustainable agriculture", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:49:19Z"}, {"key": "H6TT9HBK", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Alessandro", "lastName": "Gimona", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "J.

Each agent or actor has unique behaviors and rules which govern their interactions with each other and their environment. It is through these interactions that more macro-phenomena emerge: for example, how individual pedestrians lead to the emergence of crowds. Over the past two decades, with the growth of computational power and data, agent-based models have evolved into one of the main paradigms for urban modeling and for understanding the various processes which shape our cities. Agent-based models have been developed to explore a vast range of urban phenomena from that of micro-movement of pedestrians over seconds to that of urban growth over decades and many other issues in between. In this chapter, we introduce readers to agent-based modeling from simple abstract applications to those representing space utilizing geographical data not only for the creation of the artificial worlds but also for the validation and calibration of such models through a series of example applications. We will then discuss how big data, data mining, and machine learning techniques are advancing the field of agent-based modeling and demonstrate how such data and techniques can be leveraged into these models, giving us a new way to explore cities.", "ISBN": "9789811589836", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-8983-6_46", "extra": "DOI: 10.1007/978-981-15-8983-6_46", "bookTitle": "Urban Informatics", "place": "Singapore", "language": "en", "series": "The Urban Book Series", "libraryCatalog": "Springer Link", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T14:49:25Z", "shortTitle": "Agent-Based Modeling and the City"}, {"key": "PRFCN7ZQ", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Allison C.", "lastName": "Reilly", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Robin L.", "lastName": "Dillon", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Seth D.", "lastName": "Guikema", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Risk Analysis", "journalAbbreviation": "Risk Analysis", "volume": "41", "issue": "7", "abstractNote": "Abstract\r\n            Many of the most complicated and pressing problems in hazards research require the integration of numerous disciplines. The lack of a common knowledge base, however, often prohibits clear communication and interaction among interdisciplinary researchers, sometimes leading to unsuccessful outcomes. Drawing on experience with several projects and collective expertise that spans multiple disciplines, the authors argue that a promising way to enhance participation and enable communication is to have a common model, or boundary object, that can integrate knowledge from different disciplines. The result is that researchers from different disciplines who use different research methods and approaches can work together toward a shared goal. This article offers four requirements for boundary objects that may enhance hazards research. Based on these requirements, agent\u2010based models have the necessary characteristics to be a boundary object.

This complexity influences modeling and simulation that predict the behavior of agents as consumers. National and international disputes contribute to water management problems, especially in countries suffering from a water crisis. Researchers use a variety of frameworks to solve complex problems. One of these is the Complex Adaptive System (CAS) that has been the focus of attention in the last two decades. One approach used in this framework is the use of agent-Based Modeling (ABM). Agent-based modeling has been used to address problems in water demand management. This section discusses the importance, structure, limitations and advantages of agent-based modeling. Finally, examples of how to use agent-based modeling in addressing water demand management problems are illustrated. In first example, the ABM used to simulate and understand the effects of agent interactions and behaviors in urban water supply and demand on water scarcity condition.

This paper combines agent\u2010based modeling (ABM) with life cycle assessment (LCA) to simulate rooftop solar PV adoption in Los Angeles (LA) County from 2018\u20132050 and generate CO\r\n              2\r\n              e impact data at the societal level to compare PV and grid electricity. With respect to solar PV panels, consumer adoption is the \u201cpull\u201d that moves the system and corresponding life cycle CO\r\n              2\r\n              e impacts forward. ABM is used to evaluate the impact of policies and evolutions in technology regarding the adoption of solar PV. Life cycle assessment is used to quantify the life cycle CO\r\n              2\r\n              e impacts of solar PV (including raw materials, manufacturing, and use). The results show that scenarios that increase PV adoption also increase the CO\r\n              2\r\n              e impacts from solar PV use in the short term, due to the raw materials and manufacturing portions of the life cycle. Yet, in the long term, adoption of solar PV may provide CO\r\n              2\r\n              e impact savings from offsetting grid electricity (although this is dependent on the carbon intensity of the electricity sources). The CO\r\n              2\r\n              e impacts of solar panels are dominated by the raw materials and manufacturing phases on a product level basis, but the use phase contributes to the majority of environmental impact savings from an adoption and societal\u2010level perspective.

Six taxation interventions were implemented based on extensive reviews and meta\u2010analyses, increasing universal alcohol tax by 1, 5 and 10%, and beer tax by 1, 5 and 10%.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Findings\r\n              Under no tax increase, approximately 12.2% [95% credible interval (prediction interval, PI)\u00a0=\u00a012.1\u201312.3%] were heavy drinkers. Taxation decreased the proportion of heavy drinkers; a 10% tax decreased heavy drinking to 9.6% (95% PI\u00a0=\u00a09.4\u20139.8). Beer taxes had the strongest effect on population consumption. Taxation influenced those in the lowest income groups more than the highest income groups. Alcohol\u2010related homicide decreased from 3.22 per 100\u2009000 (95% PI\u00a0=\u00a02.50\u20133.73) to 2.40 per 100\u2009000 under a 10% universal tax (95% PI\u00a0=\u00a01.92\u20132.94). This translates into an anticipated benefit of ~1200 lives/year.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Conclusion\r\n              Reductions in alcohol consumption in a large urban environment such as New York City can be sustained with modest increases in universal taxation. Alcohol tax increases also have a modest effect on alcohol\u2010related violent victimization.

Analysing agent-based modelling outputs can be challenging, as the relationships between input parameters can be non-linear or even chaotic even in relatively simple models, and each model run can require significant CPU time. Surrogate modelling, in which a statistical model of the ABM is constructed to facilitate detailed model analyses, has been proposed as an alternative to computationally costly Monte Carlo methods. Here we compare multiple machine-learning methods for ABM surrogate modelling in order to determine the approaches best suited as a surrogate for modelling the complex behaviour of ABMs. Our results suggest that, in most scenarios, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and gradient-boosted trees outperform Gaussian process surrogates, currently the most commonly used method for the surrogate modelling of complex computational models. ANNs produced the most accurate model replications in scenarios with high numbers of model runs, although training times were longer than the other methods. We propose that agent-based modelling would benefit from using machine-learning methods for surrogate modelling, as this can facilitate more robust sensitivity analyses for the models while also reducing CPU time consumption when calibrating and analysing the simulation.", "language": "en", "ISSN": "1932-6203", "date": "2022-2-10", "pages": "e0263150", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0263150", "url": "https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263150", "title": "Using machine learning as a surrogate model for agent-based simulations", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:18:55Z"}, {"key": "AFK9SZR7", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Robert", "lastName": "Hinch", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "William J.

Policymakers are assessing how best to navigate through the ongoing epidemic, with computational models being used to predict the spread of infection and assess the impact of public health measures. Here, we present OpenABM-Covid19: an agent-based simulation of the epidemic including detailed age-stratification and realistic social networks. By default the model is parameterised to UK demographics and calibrated to the UK epidemic, however, it can easily be re-parameterised for other countries. OpenABM-Covid19 can evaluate non-pharmaceutical interventions, including both manual and digital contact tracing, and vaccination programmes. It can simulate a population of 1 million people in seconds per day, allowing parameter sweeps and formal statistical model-based inference. The code is open-source and has been developed by teams both inside and outside academia, with an emphasis on formal testing, documentation, modularity and transparency. A key feature of OpenABM-Covid19 are its Python and R interfaces, which has allowed scientists and policymakers to simulate dynamic packages of interventions and help compare options to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic.", "language": "en", "ISSN": "1553-7358", "date": "2021-7-12", "pages": "e1009146", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009146", "url": "https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009146", "title": "OpenABM-Covid19\u2014An agent-based model for non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 including contact tracing", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:19:01Z"}, {"key": "SJFSXJXC", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Noelia", "lastName": "S\u00e1nchez-Maro\u00f1o", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Alejandro", "lastName": "Rodr\u00edguez-Arias", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Adina", "lastName": "Dumitru", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Isabel", "lastName": "Lema-Blanco", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Bertha", "lastName": "Guijarro-Berdi\u00f1as", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Amparo", "lastName": "Alonso-Betanzos", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Procedia Computer Science", "journalAbbreviation": "Procedia Computer Science", "volume": "207", "language": "en", "ISSN": "18770509", "date": "2022", "pages": "2546-2555", "DOI": "10.1016/j.procs.2022.09.313", "url": "https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1877050922012029", "title": "How Agent-based modeling can help to foster sustainability projects", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:19:10Z"}, {"key": "KWLG3WM8", "version": 0, "itemType": "webpage", "creators": [{"firstName": "Raymond Hill and Frank Ciarallo", "lastName": "Brian Heath", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "title": "A Survey of Agent-Based Modeling Practices (January 1998 to July 2008)", "rights": "JASSS@soc.surrey.ac.uk", "date": "2009-10-31", "abstractNote": "In the 1990s, Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) began gaining popularity and represents a departure from the more classical simulation approaches. This departure, its recent development and its increasing application by non-traditional simulation disciplines indicates the need to continuously assess the current state of ABM and identify opportunities for improvement. To begin to satisfy this need, we surveyed and collected data from 279 articles from 92 unique publication outlets in which the authors had constructed and analyzed an agent-based model. From this large data set we establish the current practice of ABM in terms of year of publication, field of study, simulation software used, purpose of the simulation, acceptable validation criteria, validation techniques and complete description of the simulation. Based on the current practice we discuss six improvements needed to advance ABM as an analysis tool. These improvements include the development of ABM specific tools that are independent of software, the development of ABM as an independent discipline with a common language that extends across domains, the establishment of expectations for ABM that match their intended purposes, the requirement of complete descriptions of the simulation so others can independently replicate the results, the requirement that all models be completely validated and the development and application of statistical and non-statistical validation techniques specifically for ABM.", "websiteType": "Text.Article", "language": "en", "url": "https://www.jasss.org/12/4/9.html", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:19:14Z"}, {"key": "4TPGXEJY", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Marshall", "lastName": "Gangel", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Michael J.", "lastName": "Seiler", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Andrew", "lastName": "Collins", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "The Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics", "journalAbbreviation": "J Real Estate Finan Econ", "volume": "46", "issue": "2", "language": "en", "ISSN": "0895-5638, 1573-045X", "date": "2/2013", "pages": "339-354", "DOI": "10.1007/s11146-011-9324-1", "url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11146-011-9324-1", "title": "Exploring the Foreclosure Contagion Effect Using Agent-Based Modeling", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:19:17Z"}, {"key": "QDWT5Z7I", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Richard", "lastName": "Wen", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Songnian", "lastName": "Li", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Big Earth Data", "journalAbbreviation": "Big Earth Data", "volume": "5", "issue": "1", "language": "en", "ISSN": "2096-4471, 2574-5417", "date": "2021-01-02", "pages": "5-23", "DOI": "10.1080/20964471.2020.1810492", "url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20964471.2020.1810492", "title": "A review of the use of geosocial media data in agent-based models for studying urban systems", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:19:19Z"}, {"key": "ZJTMFZIW", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Andrew G.", "lastName": "Clark", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Neil", "lastName": "Walkinshaw", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Robert M.", "lastName": "Hierons", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Information and Software Technology", "journalAbbreviation": "Information and Software Technology", "volume": "135", "language": "en", "ISSN": "09505849", "date": "07/2021", "pages": "106567", "DOI": "10.1016/j.infsof.2021.106567", "url": "https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0950584921000501", "title": "Test case generation for agent-based models: A systematic literature review", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:19:26Z", "shortTitle": "Test case generation for agent-based models"}, {"key": "EJNIDG6N", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Bj\u00f6rn", "lastName": "Ross", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Laura", "lastName": "Pilz", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Benjamin", "lastName": "Cabrera", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Florian", "lastName": "Brachten", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "German", "lastName": "Neubaum", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Stefan", "lastName": "Stieglitz", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "European Journal of Information Systems", "journalAbbreviation": "European Journal of Information Systems", "volume": "28", "issue": "4", "language": "en", "ISSN": "0960-085X, 1476-9344", "date": "2019-07-04", "pages": "394-412", "DOI": "10.1080/0960085X.2018.1560920", "url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2018.1560920", "title": "Are social bots a real threat?

While providing keen insights about the role of ABMs in studying urban food environments, these studies underutilize real-world data on individual behavior in their models. This study provides a unique contribution to the ABM and food access literature by utilizing survey data to develop an empirically-rich spatially-explicit ABM of food access. This model is used to simulate and scrutinize individual travel behavior associated with accessing food in low-income neighborhoods experiencing disinvestment in Detroit (Michigan), U.S. In particular, the relationship between trip frequencies, mode of travel, store choice, and distances traveled among individuals grouped into strata based on selected sociodemographic characteristics, including household income and age, is examined. Results reveal a diversified picture of not only how income and age shape food shopping travel but also the different thresholds of tolerance for non-motorized travel to stores. Younger and poorer population subgroups have a higher propensity to utilize non-motorized travel for shopping than older and wealthier subgroups. While all groups tend to travel considerable distances outside their immediate local food environment, different sociodemographic groups maintain unique spatial patterns of grocery-shopping behavior throughout the city and the suburbs. Overall, these results challenge foundational tenets in urban planning and design, regarding the specific characteristics necessary in the built environment to facilitate accessibility to urban amenities, such as grocery stores. In neighborhoods experiencing disinvestment, sociodemographic conditions play a more important role than the built environment in shaping food accessibility and ultimately travel behavior.",

In this paper we focus on a modular type of agent based simulation model for pandemic protection. We use SOARS as an agent based simulation framework that is developed by Deguchi Laboratory, Tokyo Institute of Technology. We have developed the basic models of agent based social simulation for protecting pandemic caused by human to human outbreak of mutated H5N1 bird influenza or smallpox by bioterrorism.\n\nMethodology\nThe agent based simulation is sometime called the individual approach. The epidemic model of agent based modeling was developed by K. Carley, at C.M.U and Epstein at Brooking Institution [Carley, 2003; Epstain, 2004]. The former treats the infection by \"Anthrax\" depending on her agent based simulation with a social network of agents. The later treats the infection by smallpox on the cell based model of agent simulation. The protection policies investigated on these types of agent based approaches include vaccination, isolation and blockade. These types of policies are connected to agent activities in the societies. \nThe cell type model is basic and intuitive. Then it is widely used. In the simulation model of emerging influenza pandemic in Southeast Asia they use the cell type model for analyzing the effectiveness of \"Oseltamivir (Tamiflu)\" [Ferguson, 2005]. We have introduced another type of model for agent based approach. We introduce the concept of spot that is a place on which agents interact. Agents also move among spots depending on their social roles. Spots stand for home, office, school, hospital, train  and other social places depending on the model scope and subdivision of the model. For the purpose have developed the agent based simulation framework called SOARS . \n\nModel\nThe simulation model is divided into three basic modules. The one is a state transition module of disease under the physical condition and medical treatment(fig. 1). The next is a contamination and infection module that contains six types of protection policies of contamination and infection. The third is a human activity module on a virtual city that contains several types of social activities of agents(fig.2).  We combined these modules  and introduced the social and medical protection policies. We evaluated the protection policies on the combined model. \n\nResult\nWe have simulated 23 scenarios of pandemic and its protection policies such as the limit of the stock of vaccine, delay of starting vaccination, speed of vaccination and school closing(fig. 3).\nAs a result we have shown that enough stock of vaccination and quick vaccination are effective to decrease the damage. \n\nConsideration\nAgent based epidemiological simulation is an effective way of making model with the  collaboration of domain experts. It is important that various types of specialists such as systems analysts, public health specialists, medical doctors and urban planners can collaborate on the modeling of simulation for protecting emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases including the smallpox. We have developed the group programming methodology with SOARS where the system analysts and domain experts cooperate with each other for quick development of the mode.\n\nReference\n[Carley, 2003] K.

The rapid spread of the outbreak requires fast\u2010paced decision\u2010making regarding mitigation measures. However, the evidence for the efficacy of non\u2010pharmaceutical interventions such as imposed social distancing and school or workplace closures is scarce: few observational studies use quasi\u2010experimental research designs, and conducting randomized controlled trials seems infeasible. Additionally, evidence from the previous coronavirus outbreaks of SARS and MERS lacks external validity, given the significant differences in contagiousness of those pathogens relative to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. To address the pressing policy questions that have emerged as a result of COVID\u201019, epidemiologists have produced numerous models that range from simple compartmental models to highly advanced agent\u2010based models. These models have been criticized for involving simplifications and lacking empirical support for their assumptions.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Methods\r\n              To address these voices and methodologically appraise epidemiological ABMs, we consider AceMod (the model of the COVID\u201019 epidemic in Australia) as a case study of the modelling practice.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Results\r\n              Our example shows that, although epidemiological ABMs involve simplifications of various sorts, the key characteristics of social interactions and the spread of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 are represented sufficiently accurately.

Using agent\u2010based models, we find that when organizational identification is high, external change agents who attempt to direct organizations by introducing policy aligned messages (e.g., professional development emphasizing specific teaching practices) may unintentionally contribute to divergence in practice and polarization in networks, inhibiting full implementation of the desired practices as well as reducing organizational capacity to absorb new practices. Thus, the external change agent should consider the interaction between the type of message and the intraorganizational network dynamics driven by organizational identification.", "language": "en", "ISSN": "0276-8739, 1520-6688", "date": "09/2018", "pages": "867-895", "DOI": "10.1002/pam.22081", "url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pam.22081", "title": "IMPLEMENTATION OF EVIDENCE\u2010BASED PRACTICE IN HUMAN SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: IMPLICATIONS FROM AGENT\u2010BASED MODELS", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:21:30Z", "shortTitle": "IMPLEMENTATION OF EVIDENCE\u2010BASED PRACTICE IN HUMAN SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS"}, {"key": "G7XWCJI4", "version": 0, "itemType": "bookSection", "creators": [{"firstName": "Prakash C.", "lastName": "Sukhwal", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Atreyi", "lastName": "Kankanhalli", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Yannis", "lastName": "Charalabidis", "creatorType": "editor"}, {"firstName": "Leif Skiftenes", "lastName": "Flak", "creatorType": "editor"}, {"firstName": "Gabriela", "lastName": "Viale Pereira", "creatorType": "editor"}], "tags": [{"tag": "e-governance", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Digital governance", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Agent-based modeling (ABM)", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Literature review", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Future research", "type": 1}], "date": "2022", "title": "Agent-based Modeling in Digital Governance Research: A Review and Future Research Directions", "pages": "303-331", "publisher": "Springer International Publishing", "abstractNote": "Digital governanceDigital governance involves the application of information and communication technology (ICT) for achieving efficiency and effectiveness in government functions for all stakeholders.

For example, South Korea started a vigorous campaign to suppress the virus by testing patients with respiratory symptoms and tracing and isolating all their contacts, and many European countries are trying to slow down the spread of the virus with varying degrees of shutdowns. There is clearly a need for a model that can realistically simulate different policy actions and their impacts on the disease and health care capacity in a country or a region. Specifically, there is a need to identify destructive policies, i.e. policies that are, based on scientific knowledge, worse than an alternative and should not be implemented.\nMethods We developed an agent-based model (REINA) using Python and accelerated it by the Cython optimising static compiler. It follows a population over time at individual level at different stages of the disease and estimates the number of patients in hospitals and in intensive care. It estimates death rates and counts based on the treatment available. Any number of interventions can be added on the timeline from a selection including e.g. physical isolation, testing and tracing, and controlling the amount of cases entering the area. The model has open source code and runs online.\nResults The model uses the demographics of the Helsinki University Hospital region (1.6 million inhabitants). A mitigation strategy aims to slow down the spread of the epidemic to maintain the hospital capacity by implementing mobility restrictions. A suppression strategy initially consists of the same restrictions but also aggressive testing, tracing, and isolating all coronavirus positive patients and their contacts. The modelling starting point is 2020-02-18. The strategies follow the actual situation until 2020-04-06 and then diverge. The default mitigation scenario with variable 30\u201340% mobility reduction appears to delay the peak of the epidemic (as intended) but not suppress the disease. In the suppression strategy, active testing and tracing of patients with symptoms and their contacts is implemented in addition to 20\u201325% mobility reduction. This results in a reduction of the cumulative number of infected individuals from 820 000 to 80 000 and the number of deaths from 6000 to only 640, when compared with the mitigation strategy (during the first year of the epidemic).\nDiscussion The agent-based model (REINA) can be used to simulate epidemic outcomes for various types of policy actions on a timeline. Our results lend support to the strategy of combining comprehensive testing, contact tracing and targeted isolation measures with social isolation measures. While social isolation is important in the early stages to prevent explosive growth, relying on social isolation alone (the mitigation strategy) appears to be a destructive policy. The open-source nature of the model facilitates rapid further development. The flexibility of the modelling logic supports the future implementation of several already identified refinements in terms of more realistic population models and new types of more specific policy interventions. Improving estimates of epidemic parameters will make it possible to improve modelling accuracy further.", "language": "en", "url": "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20047498v2", "pages": "2020.04.09.20047498", "libraryCatalog": "medRxiv", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:21:44Z", "extra": "Type: article"}, {"key": "SDLXNLFJ", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Timo", "lastName": "Szczepanska", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Patrycja", "lastName": "Antosz", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Jan Ole", "lastName": "Berndt", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Melania", "lastName": "Borit", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Edmund", "lastName": "Chattoe-Brown", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Sara", "lastName": "Mehryar", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Ruth", "lastName": "Meyer", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Stephan", "lastName": "Onggo", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Harko", "lastName": "Verhagen", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "International Journal of Social Research Methodology", "journalAbbreviation": "International Journal of Social Research Methodology", "volume": "25", "issue": "4", "language": "en", "ISSN": "1364-5579, 1464-5300", "date": "2022-07-04", "pages": "541-555", "DOI": "10.1080/13645579.2022.2050119", "url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13645579.2022.2050119", "title": "GAM on!

This paper introduces one such effort that is specifically designed for studies of transportation mode choices in metropolitan areas. It provides results from a high-resolution data driven simulation based on high performance computing implementation of the agent-based model framework for home-to-work commute trips. The framework uses a graph-partition based technique that can leverage the interaction structure of agents within a geographic proximity and can boost the simulation execution time. Further, based on a flexible design, it can run ABM with different levels of computing resources-from multi core workstations to an HPC grid. The framework has been tested on the Titan Cray XK7 supercomputer of the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility.", "language": "English", "url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1559733", "libraryCatalog": "www.osti.gov", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:22:03Z", "extra": "DOI: 10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569232"}, {"key": "8C85TSYS", "version": 0, "itemType": "conferencePaper", "creators": [{"firstName": "Bhakti Stephan", "lastName": "Onggo", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Jo\u00ebl", "lastName": "Foramitti", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "proceedingsTitle": "2021 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)", "place": "Phoenix, AZ, USA", "conferenceName": "2021 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)", "ISBN": "9781665433112", "publisher": "IEEE", "date": "2021-12-12", "pages": "1-15", "DOI": "10.1109/WSC52266.2021.9715352", "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9715352/", "title": "Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation For Business and Management: A Review and Tutorial", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:22:07Z", "shortTitle": "Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation For Business and Management"}, {"key": "C3V29K9X", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Alys", "lastName": "McAlpine", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Ligia", "lastName": "Kiss", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Cathy", "lastName": "Zimmerman", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Zaid", "lastName": "Chalabi", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Journal of Computational Social Science", "journalAbbreviation": "J Comput Soc Sc", "volume": "4", "issue": "1", "abstractNote": "Abstract\r\n            This systematic review aims to synthesize how agent-based modeling (ABM) has been used in migration and modern slavery research and provide the basis to model development for social science researchers exploring the use of ABM. We searched five bibliographic databases using two terminology categories: (1) migration or modern slavery terminology; (2) complex system methods terminology. Two reviewers conducted independent article screening. Peer-reviewed articles presenting original migration or modern slavery ABMs were included. Data extraction included model development steps and model characteristics. The dataset was synthesized and compared across studies. We identified 28 articles for inclusion. Many of the ABMs tested theories and about half were based on empirical data. Model development varied considerably and reported methods were extremely opaque. Only five studies used a structured development framework. The most common model involved agents deciding whether and where to migrate and attempting migration. Climate change was a common exogenous scenario modeled. Most of the ABMs did not undergo any sensitivity analysis or validation.ABM has a greater capacity to account for heterogeneous and dynamic decision-making than more frequently applied methods in research on migration and modern slavery. However, there is still a paucity of studies adopting ABM methods. These reviewed ABMs highlight gaps in the reporting and implementing of model development. ABM is a promising technique to address many urgent and complex questions in research on migration and modern slavery to better support decision-makers, but addressing current methodological gaps is a critical first step.", "language": "en", "ISSN": "2432-2717, 2432-2725", "date": "05/2021", "pages": "243-332", "DOI": "10.1007/s42001-020-00076-7", "url": "https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s42001-020-00076-7", "title": "Agent-based modeling for migration and modern slavery research: a systematic review", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:22:13Z", "shortTitle": "Agent-based modeling for migration and modern slavery research"}, {"key": "9TGE88RR", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "David", "lastName": "O\u2019Sullivan", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Tom", "lastName": "Evans", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Steven", "lastName": "Manson", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Sara", "lastName": "Metcalf", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Arika", "lastName": "Ligmann-Zielinska", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Chris", "lastName": "Bone", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Journal of Land Use Science", "journalAbbreviation": "Journal of Land Use Science", "volume": "11", "issue": "2", "language": "en", "ISSN": "1747-423X, 1747-4248", "date": "2016-03-03", "pages": "177-187", "DOI": "10.1080/1747423X.2015.1030463", "url": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1747423X.2015.1030463", "title": "Strategic directions for agent-based modeling: avoiding the YAAWN syndrome", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:22:31Z", "shortTitle": "Strategic directions for agent-based modeling"}, {"key": "SZ9YQATP", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Kostas", "lastName": "Cheliotis", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Computers, Environment and Urban Systems", "journalAbbreviation": "Computers, Environment and Urban Systems", "volume": "81", "language": "en", "ISSN": "01989715", "date": "05/2020", "pages": "101476", "DOI": "10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101476", "url": "https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0198971519302261", "title": "An agent-based model of public space use", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:22:38Z"}, {"key": "4XW4FJLS", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Marcello", "lastName": "Marini", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Ndaona", "lastName": "Chokani", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Reza S.", "lastName": "Abhari", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Journal of International Migration and Integration", "journalAbbreviation": "Int.

Therefore, in this study, we built a stylized agent-based model with individual behaviours based on Alonso\u2019s bid rent theory and ran simulations with different combinations of income level and income inequality. We measured the overall emergent patterns with indicators for urban sprawl and income segregation. The model confirms the established positive correlations between income level and urban sprawl and between income inequality and segregation. Furthermore, the model shows a negative correlation between urban sprawl and income segregation under free market conditions.

Some system science traditions, specifically system dynamics modeling, have an established participatory practice tradition. Yet, there remains limited guidance on engagement strategies using other modeling approaches like agent-based models. Our objective is to describe how we engaged adolescent youth in co-building an agent-based model about physical activity. Specifically, we aim to describe how we communicated technical aspects of agent-based models, the participatory activities we developed, and the resulting visual diagrams that were produced. We implemented six sessions with nine adolescent participants. To make technical aspects more accessible, we used an analogy that linked core components of agent-based models to elements of storytelling. We also implemented novel, facilitated activities that engaged youth in the development, annotation, and review of graphs over time, geographical maps, and state charts. The process was well-received by the participants and helped inform the basic structure of an agent-based model. The resulting visual diagrams created space for deeper discussion among participants about patterns of daily activity, important places for physical activity, and interactions between social and built environments.

With many suffering from opioid use disorder first having encountered opioids via prescription routes, practitioners and health systems have an enduring need to identify and effectively respond to the problematic use of opioid prescription. There are strong challenges to successfully addressing this need: importantly, the patterns of prescription fulfillment that signal opioid abuse can be subtle and difficult to recognize, and overzealous enforcement can deprive those with legitimate pain management needs the appropriate care. Moreover, injudicious responses risk shifting those suffering from early-stage abuse of prescribed opioids to illicitly sourced street alternatives, whose varying dosage, availability, and the risk of adulteration can pose grave health risks.MethodsThis study employs a dynamic modeling and simulation to evaluate the effectiveness of prescription regimes employing machine learning monitoring programs to identify the patients who are at risk of opioid abuse while being treated with prescribed opioids. To this end, an agent-based model was developed and implemented to examine the effect of reduced prescribing and prescription drug monitoring programs on overdose and escalation to street opioids among patients, and on the legitimacy of fulfillments of opioid prescriptions over a 5-year time horizon. A study released by the Canadian Institute for Health Information was used to estimate the parameter values and assist in the validation of the existing agent-based model.Results and discussionThe model estimates that lowering the prescription doses exerted the most favorable impact on the outcomes of interest over 5 years with a minimum burden on patients with a legitimate need for pharmaceutical opioids. The accurate conclusion about the impact of public health interventions requires a comprehensive set of outcomes to test their multi-dimensional effects, as utilized in this research. Finally, combining machine learning and agent-based modeling can provide significant advantages, particularly when using the latter to gain insights into the long-term effects and dynamic circumstances of the former.", "date": "2023", "publicationTitle": "Frontiers in Digital Health", "libraryCatalog": "Frontiers", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:24:01Z", "shortTitle": "Opioid-related harms and care impacts of conventional and AI-based prescription management strategies"}, {"key": "VN68SV99", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Fardad", "lastName": "Haghpanah", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Kimia", "lastName": "Ghobadi", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Benjamin W.", "lastName": "Schafer", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction", "journalAbbreviation": "International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction", "volume": "66", "language": "en", "ISSN": "22124209", "date": "12/2021", "pages": "102632", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102632", "url": "https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2212420921005938", "title": "Multi-hazard hospital evacuation planning during disease outbreaks using agent-based modeling", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:24:04Z"}, {"key": "IVDE2K4E", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Anthony", "lastName": "Patt", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Bernd", "lastName": "Siebenh\u00fcner", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Vierteljahrshefte zur Wirtschaftsforschung", "journalAbbreviation": "Vierteljahrshefte zur Wirtschaftsforschung", "volume": "74", "issue": "2", "language": "en", "ISSN": "0340-1707, 1861-1559", "date": "04/2005", "pages": "310-320", "DOI": "10.3790/vjh.74.2.310", "url": "https://elibrary.duncker-humblot.com/doi:10.3790/vjh.74.2.310", "title": "Agent Based Modeling and Adaptation to Climate Change", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:24:09Z"}, {"key": "XQP93WR7", "version": 0, "itemType": "bookSection", "creators": [{"firstName": "Vincent G.", "lastName": "Duffy", "creatorType": "editor"}, {"firstName": "Carl Orge", "lastName": "Retzlaff", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Martina", "lastName": "Ziefle", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Andr\u00e9", "lastName": "Calero Valdez", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "bookTitle": "Digital Human Modeling and Applications in Health, Safety, Ergonomics and Risk Management.

These variants can be more infectious than existing strains and many of them are also more resistant to available vaccines. The appearance of these new variants cause\u00a0new surges of infections, exacerbated by infrastructural difficulties, such as shortages of medical personnel or test kits. In this work, a high\u2010resolution computational framework for modeling the simultaneous spread of two COVID\u201019 variants: a widely spread base variant and a new one, is established.

The results suggest that the spread of new variants can be contained with highly efficacious tests and mild loss of vaccine protection.

While these models can provide unique and timely insight into the potential of prevention strategies, an ABM\u2019s ability to do so depends strongly on its accuracy in capturing the phenomenon.

The counterforce, such as the policemen, is of great significance to reducing casualties, which is the core issue of social safety governance. Therefore, we model both the killing force and counterforce, to explore the crowd dynamics under the shooting. Taking the \u201cBorderline\u201d shooting in 2018 as the target case, the agent-based modeling is applied to back-calculate this dynamic process and explore key behavior rules of individuals. The real death tolls of three classes of agents (civilians, policemen, & killers) are as the real function, based on which we calculate the gaps between real target case and simulations. Eventually, we obtain three optimal solutions, which achieve the least gap or highest matching degree. Besides, we make counterfactual inferences under the optimal solutions, to explore the strategic interactions between policemen and killers. For strategies of killers, we explore different sizes, positions, and moving patterns of the killers. The optimal size of policemen is four to five, for each one killer. For strategies of policemen, we explore the size, locations, and the response time. It indicates that optimal response time of policemen is thirty to forty shots of the killer, and the death of civilians and policemen can be minimized, and the death probability of the killer can be maximized.

It is designed primarily for ABMs of mobile individuals with local interactions in a grid space, but not necessarily clumsy for others. NetLogo is highly recommended, even for prototyping complex models. MASON, Repast, and Swarm are \u201cframework and library\u201d platforms, providing a conceptual framework for organizing and designing ABMs and corresponding software libraries. MASON is least mature and designed with execution speed a high priority. The Objective-C version of Swarm is the most mature library platform and is stable and well organized. Objective-C seems more natural than Java for ABMs but weak error-handling and the lack of developer tools are drawbacks. Java Swarm allows Swarm\u2019s Objective-C libraries to be called from Java; it does not seem to combine the advantages of the two languages well. Repast provides Swarm-like functions in a Java library and is a good choice for many, but parts of its organization and design could be improved. A rough comparison of execution speed found MASON and Repast usually fastest (MASON 1-35% faster than Repast), Swarm (including Objective-C) fastest for simple models but slowest for complex ones, and NetLogo intermediate.

An ABM is a computational instantiation of a complex adaptive system (CAS). A CAS is a dynamic model that represents individual agents and their collective behavior.22The study of CASs, both theoretically and through computer simulations, was central to the research program of the Santa Fe Institute in the 1980s and 1990s and was stimulated, in particular, by John Holland\u2019s work on genetic algorithms and classifier systems. His 1975 book (Holland, 1975) was certainly influential at SFI. In social science applications, agents are usually people. CASs, however, have applications in many different systems, in which agency has many different interpretations. Generally speaking, an agent is a persistent entity that is described by states and behaviors, which are consequences of the agent\u2019s state. The agent\u2019s state is modified by its interactions with other agents. The agent population is usually not modeled as a \u201cgas\u201d of randomly interacting particles.33In models describing social phenomena at higher levels of aggregation, the \u201cgas\u201d assumption is common. See the discussion of the SIS model below. Instead there will typically be some structure to agents\u2019 interactions: The set of others with whom any agent can interact is circumscribed. This structure is usually described by a social network; agents interact only with their neighbors.", "language": "en", "bookTitle": "Assessing the Use of Agent-Based Models for Tobacco Regulation",

Machine learning (ML) refers to computational approaches whereby algorithms use statistical methods to \u201clearn\u201d from data on their own, i.e., without imposing any a priori model/theory onto a system or its behavior. Biological systems\u2014ranging from molecules, to cells, to entire organisms, to whole populations and even ecosystems\u2014consist of vast numbers of discrete entities, governed by complex webs of interactions that span various spatiotemporal scales and exhibit nonlinearity, stochasticity, and variable degrees of coupling between entities. For these reasons, the macroscopic properties and collective dynamics of biological systems are generally difficult to accurately model or predict via continuum modeling techniques and mean-field formalisms. ABM takes a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach that obviates common difficulties of other modeling approaches by enabling one to relatively easily create (or at least propose, for testing) a set of well-defined \u201crules\u201d to be applied to the individual entities (agents) in a system. Quantitatively evaluating a system and propagating its state over a series of discrete time-steps effectively simulates the system, allowing various observables to be computed and the system\u2019s properties to be analyzed. Because the rules that govern an ABM can be difficult to abstract and formulate from experimental data, at least in an unbiased way, there is a uniquely synergistic opportunity to employ ML to help infer optimal, system-specific ABM rules. Once such rule-sets are devised, running ABM calculations can generate a wealth of data, and ML can be applied in that context too\u2014for example, to generate statistical measures that accurately and meaningfully describe the stochastic outputs of a system and its properties. As an example of synergy in the other direction (from ABM to ML), ABM simulations can generate plausible (realistic) datasets for training ML algorithms (e.g., for regularization, to mitigate overfitting). In these ways, one can envision a variety of synergistic ABM\u21c4ML loops. After introducing some basic ideas about ABMs and ML, and their limitations, this Review describes examples of how ABM and ML have been integrated in diverse contexts, spanning spatial scales that include multicellular and tissue-scale biology to human population-level epidemiology. In so doing, we have used published studies as a guide to identify ML approaches that are well-suited to particular types of ABM applications, based on the scale of the biological system and the properties of the available data.", "date": "2022", "publicationTitle": "Frontiers in Systems Biology", "libraryCatalog": "Frontiers", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:31:10Z"}, {"key": "CZGYLYQ4", "version": 0, "itemType": "webpage", "creators": [], "tags": [], "title": "An Agent-Based Modeling Simulation Study in China: Will Adjusting Medical Insurance Reimbursement Rates Impact Hierarchical Diagnosis and Treatment?", "url": "https://www.researchsquare.com", "abstractNote": "Background Promoting hierarchical diagnosis and treatment is important to deepen medical reform in China.

Agent-based models (ABMs) are, however, also vulnerable to critique, as they often employ stylized social worlds, with little connection to the actual environment in question. Given these concerns, there has been a recent call to more fully incorporate empirical data into ABMs. This article falls in this tradition, exploring the benefits of using sampled ego network data in ABMs of cultural diffusion. Thus, instead of relying on full network data, which can be difficult and costly to collect, or no empirical network data, which is convenient but not empirically grounded, we offer a middle-ground, one combining ABMs with recent work on network sampling. The main question is whether this approach is effective. We provide a test of the approach using six complete networks; the test also includes a range of diffusion models (where actors follow different rules of adoption). For each network, we take a random ego network sample and use that sample to infer the full network structure. We then run a diffusion model through the known, complete networks, as well as the inferred networks, and compare the results. The results, on the whole, are quite strong: Across all analyses, the diffusion curves based on the sampled data are very similar to the curves based on the true, complete network. This suggests that ego network sampling can, in fact, offer a practical means of incorporating empirical data into an agent-based model.", "language": "en", "ISSN": "0049-1241, 1552-8294", "date": "11/2020", "pages": "1018-1063", "DOI": "10.1177/0049124118769100", "url": "http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0049124118769100", "title": "Using Ego Network Data to Inform Agent-based Models of Diffusion", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:31:55Z"}, {"key": "FENYUKXZ", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Gianfranco", "lastName": "Giulioni", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Social Science Computer Review", "journalAbbreviation": "Social Science Computer Review", "volume": "37", "issue": "3", "abstractNote": "The present work provides an open-source, agent-based behavioral model primarily addressed to the dynamics associated with the commodities spot price formation, as well as variations and contrast patterns belonging to the exchanged quantity.

Simulations were performed to contrast the potential effects of various policies on the evolution of dietary decisions.\r\n            Results. Our model showed that a 20% increase in taxes on fast foods would lower the probability of fast-food consumption by 3 percentage points, whereas improving the visibility of positive social norms by 10%, either through community-based or mass-media campaigns, could improve the consumption of fruits and vegetables by 7 percentage points and lower fast-food consumption by 6 percentage points.

Based on the life cycle law, focusing on the life cycle process of COVID-19 online collective actions, we carried out both macro-level analysis (big data mining) and micro-level behaviors (Agent-Based Modeling) on pandemic-related online collective actions. We collected 138 related online events with macro-level big data characteristics, and used Agent-Based Modeling to capture micro-level individual behaviors of netizens. We set two kinds of movable agents, Hots (events) and Netizens (individuals), which behave smartly and autonomously. Based on multiple simulations and parametric traversal, we obtained the optimal parameter solution. Under the optimal solutions, we repeated simulations by ten times, and took the mean values as robust outcomes. Simulation outcomes well match the real big data of life cycle trends, and validity and robustness can be achieved. According to multiple criteria (spans, peaks, ratios, and distributions), the fitness between simulations and real big data has been substantially supported. Therefore, our Agent-Based Modeling well grasps the micro-level mechanisms of real-world individuals (netizens), based on which we can predict individual behaviors of netizens and big data trends of specific online events. Based on our model, it is feasible to model, calculate, and even predict evolutionary dynamics and life cycles trends of online collective actions.

Many natural and social phenomena can be represented in form of complex simulations so over time agent models and multi-agent systems have proven to be a really powerful tool in areas such as economics and trade, health, urban planning and social sciences. In addition multi-agent systems can be represented as an artificial society similar to a human one and consisting of entities with characteristics similar to human ones, for example in terms of autonomy and intelligence. ABM are based on the principle of objective orientation as well as the evolution (training) of agents in the process of modeling various variants of the proposed events. Despite the apparent simplicity of the rules of interaction between agents the results are usually non-obvious and quite meaningful. ABM can be developed both at the micro level and represent models with multiple agents at the macro level. The concept of multi-agent systems which immediately gained followers and support in both scientific circles and industrial communities, first started talking in the mid-1980s. Over the past thirty years, the methodology of IAU creation has been constantly improved: technologies and tools for its promotion and use in the management of large-scale network structures (such as defense systems, energy, health, transport, logistics, urban management, collective robotics, etc.) have been actively developed. The scope of application of MAS is very wide. The analysis of implemented MAS proves that currently the tool is the most advanced technology for managing any objects built on the principles of self-organization. However, despite all the evidence of positive prospects for the introduction of AOM technology the number of examples of its successful application to date is small. In this regard creation of new platforms for discussion of international experience and improvement of the approach to simulation modeling in general is especially important for further dissemination of AMB and MAS. Creation of an open consortium for agent-oriented modeling as well as promotion of development, communication and dissemination of research results as well as implementation of educational activities together will contribute to the development of agent based modeling. The analysis and review of existing methodology of social modeling with use of agent based approach in the application to scientific and technical development, implementation of R&D and maintenance of innovative potential showed that models characterized by complex multi-level processes and interactions of agents have more capacious software structures which depend more on the \"fine\" tuning of the agents themselves.

We explored each modeling approach within an applied example: interventions to reduce posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We used data from a cohort of 2,282 adults representative of the adult population of the New York City metropolitan area from 2002\u20132006, of whom 16.3% developed PTSD over their lifetimes. We built 4 models: g-computation, an agent-based model (ABM) with no between-agent interactions, an ABM with violent-interaction dynamics, and an ABM with neighborhood dynamics. Three interventions were tested: 1) reducing violent victimization by 37.2% (real-world reduction); 2) reducing violent victimization by100%; and 3) supplementing the income of 20% of lower-income participants. The g-computation model estimated population-level PTSD risk reductions of 0.12% (95% confidence interval (CI): \u22120.16, 0.29), 0.28% (95% CI: \u22120.30, 0.70), and 1.55% (95% CI: 0.40, 2.12), respectively. The ABM with no interactions replicated the findings from g-computation. Introduction of interaction dynamics modestly decreased estimated intervention effects (income-supplement risk reduction dropped to 1.47%), whereas introduction of neighborhood dynamics modestly increased effectiveness (income-supplement risk reduction increased to 1.58%).

Epidemic simulation models and pandemic control methods are designed to tackle this problem. However, most of the existing approaches cannot be applied to real-world cases due to the lack of adaptability to new scenarios and micro representational ability (especially for system dynamics models), the huge computation demand, and the inefficient use of historical information.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Methods\r\n              We propose a novel Pandemic Control decision making framework via large-scale Agent-based modeling and deep Reinforcement learning (PaCAR) to search optimal control policies that can simultaneously minimize the spread of infection and the government restrictions. In the framework, we develop a new large-scale agent-based simulator with vaccine settings implemented to be calibrated and serve as a realistic environment for a city or a state. We also design a novel reinforcement learning architecture applicable to the pandemic control problem, with a reward carefully designed by the net monetary benefit framework and a sequence learning network to extract information from the sequential epidemiological observations, such as number of cases, vaccination, and so forth.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Results\r\n              Our approach outperforms the baselines designed by experts or adopted by real-world governments and is flexible in dealing with different variants, such as Alpha and Delta in COVID-19. PaCAR succeeds in controlling the pandemic with the lowest economic costs and relatively short epidemic duration and few cases. We further conduct extensive experiments to analyze the reasoning behind the resulting policy sequence and try to conclude this as an informative reference for policy makers in the post-vaccination era of COVID-19 and beyond.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Limitations\r\n              The modeling of economic costs, which are directly estimated by the level of government restrictions, is rather simple. This article mainly focuses on several specific control methods and single-wave pandemic control.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Conclusions\r\n              The proposed framework PaCAR can offer adaptive pandemic control recommendations on different variants and population sizes. Intelligent pandemic control empowered by artificial intelligence may help us make it through the current COVID-19 and other possible pandemics in the future with less cost both of lives and economy.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Highlights\r\n              We introduce a new efficient, large-scale agent-based epidemic simulator in our framework PaCAR, which can be applied to train reinforcement learning networks in a real-world scenario with a population of more than 10,000,000. We develop a novel learning mechanism in PaCAR, which augments reinforcement learning with sequence learning, to learn the tradeoff policy decision of saving lives and economic development in the post-vaccination era. We demonstrate that the policy learned by PaCAR outperforms different benchmark policies under various reality conditions during COVID-19. We analyze the resulting policy given by PaCAR, and the lessons may shed light on better pandemic preparedness plans in the future.", "language": "en", "ISSN": "0272-989X, 1552-681X", "date":

Water utility companies use water-pricing policies as an instrument for controlling residential water demand. To support policy makers in their decisions, the authors have developed DAWN, a hybrid model for evaluating water-pricing policies. DAWN integrates an agent-based social model for the consumer with conventional econometric models and simulates the residential water demand-supply chain, enabling the evaluation of different scenarios for policy making. An agent community is assigned to behave as water consumers, while econometric and social models are incorporated into them for estimating water consumption.

The goal of this article is to explain how agent-based modeling could fulfill this role.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Methods:\r\n              We describe agent-based modeling with respect to other simulation methods that have been used in implementation science, using non-technical language that is broadly accessible. We then provide a stepwise procedure for developing agent-based models of implementation processes. We use, as a case study to illustrate the procedure, the implementation of evidence-based smoking cessation practices for persons with serious mental illness (SMI) in community mental health clinics.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Results:\r\n              For our case study, we present descriptions of the motivating research questions, specific models used to answer these questions, and a summary of the insights that can be obtained from the models.

Such models have not yet been widely used in implementation science, partly because they are not straightforward to develop. To promote the use of agent-based modeling we provide a stepwise procedure using non-technical language and emphasizing the relationships between the model and implementation processes. We used two detailed examples to demonstrate our proposed approach. In the first example, we simulate the observed smoking behaviors of persons with serious mental illness in a recently completed trial (IDEAL, Comprehensive Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Trial in Persons with Serious Mental Illness). In the second example, we illustrate how agent-based models that include interactions between patients, providers and site administrators can be used to provide guidance for an implementation intervention that includes training and organizational strategies. This example is based in part on an ongoing project focused on scaling up evidence-based tobacco smoking cessation practices in community mental health clinics in Maryland. For this example, we show how the visual user interface of an agent-based model can be in the form of a dashboard with levers for simulating what-if scenarios that can be used to guide implementation decisions. In summary, this paper shows how agent-based models can provide insights into the processes in complex interventions, and guide implementation decisions for improving delivery of evidence-based practices in community mental health clinics.", "language": "en", "ISSN": "2633-4895, 2633-4895", "date": "01/2021", "pages": "263348952110106", "DOI": "10.1177/26334895211010664", "url": "http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/26334895211010664", "title": "Agent-based modeling for implementation research: An application to tobacco smoking cessation for persons with serious mental illness", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:38:04Z", "shortTitle": "Agent-based modeling for implementation research"}, {"key": "S5FYSLSL", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Jose", "lastName": "Simmonds", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Juan A.", "lastName": "G\u00f3mez", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Agapito", "lastName": "Ledezma", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Journal of Water and Climate Change", "volume": "11", "issue": "4", "abstractNote": "Abstract\r\n            Flood problems are complex phenomena with a direct relationship with the hydrological cycle; these are natural processes occurring in water systems, that interact at different spatial and temporal scales. In modeling the hydrological phenomena, traditional approaches, like physics-based mathematical equations and data-driven modeling (DDM) are used. Advances in hydroinformatics are helping to understand these physical processes, with improvements in the collection and analysis of hydrological data, information and communication technologies (ICT), and geographic information systems (GIS), offering opportunities for innovations in model implementation, to improve decision support for the response to societally important floods impacting our societies. This paper offers a brief review of agent-based models (ABMs) and multi-agent systems (MASs) methodologies' applications for solutions to flood problems, their management, assessment, and efforts for forecasting stream flow and flood events. Significant observations from this review include: (i) contributions of agent technologies, as a growing methodology in hydrology; (ii) limitations; (iii) capabilities of dealing with distributed and complex domains; and (iv), the capabilities of MAS as an increasingly accepted point of view applied to flood modeling, with examples presented to show the variety of system combinations that are practical on a specialized architectural level for developing and deploying sophisticated flood forecasting systems.", "language": "en", "ISSN": "2040-2244, 2408-9354", "date": "2020-12-01", "pages": "1580-1602", "DOI": "10.2166/wcc.2019.108", "url": "https://iwaponline.com/jwcc/article/11/4/1580/70336/The-role-of-agent-based-modeling-and-multi-agent", "title": "The role of agent-based modeling and multi-agent systems in flood-based hydrological problems: a brief review", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:38:09Z", "shortTitle": "The role of agent-based modeling and multi-agent systems in flood-based hydrological problems"}, {"key": "Z9P8U4RT", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Venu K.", "lastName": "Kandiah", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Emily Z.", "lastName": "Berglund", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Andrew R.", "lastName": "Binder", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Sustainable Cities and Society", "journalAbbreviation": "Sustainable Cities and Society", "volume": "46", "language": "en", "ISSN": "22106707", "date": "04/2019", "pages": "101412", "DOI": "10.1016/j.scs.2018.12.040", "url": "https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2210670718308126", "title": "An agent-based modeling approach to project adoption of water reuse and evaluate expansion plans within a sociotechnical water infrastructure system", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:38:22Z"}, {"key": "MKED7K7D", "version": 0, "itemType": "conferencePaper", "creators": [{"firstName": "Charles M.", "lastName": "Macal", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Michael J.", "lastName": "North", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "proceedingsTitle": "2008 Winter Simulation Conference", "place": "Miami, FL, USA", "conferenceName": "2008 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)", "ISBN": "9781424427079", "publisher": "IEEE", "date": "12/2008", "pages": "101-112", "DOI": "10.1109/WSC.2008.4736060", "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4736060/", "title": "Agent-based modeling and simulation: ABMS examples", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:38:29Z", "shortTitle": "Agent-based modeling and simulation"}, {"key": "HFFBXB3S", "version": 0, "itemType": "report", "creators": [{"firstName": "Seokbeom", "lastName": "Kwon", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Kazuyuki", "lastName": "Motohashi", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [{"tag": "Non-practicing Entity (NPE)", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Patent Assertion Entity (PAE)", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Patent troll", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Patent policy", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Innovation Policy", "type": 1}], "title": "Effect of Non-Practicing Entities on Innovation Society and Policy: An Agent Based Model and Simulation", "date": "2014-05-15", "url": "https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2606678", "abstractNote": "Effect of Non-practicing entities (NPE) on innovation society has been a controversial issue owing to their having both positive and negative impacts.

Crime is a particularly difficult phenomenon to model because of its inherent complexity; crime patterns are built up from a multitude of human-human and human-environment micro-interactions that ultimately lead to individual crime events. Commonly used modelling techniques, such as regression, struggle to fully account for the dynamics of the crime system. They work at aggregate scales thereby disregarding important individual-level variation and also struggle to account for the effects of different types of human behaviour. Furthermore, important concepts from environmental criminology \u2013 such as individual offender awareness spaces or heterogeneity in offender decision-making \u2013 cannot be included directly when working at a resolution above that of the individual.\r\n            This research addresses the drawbacks associated with traditional mathematical crime models by building an agent-based simulation with a unique offender behavioural model. Through use of the PECS framework for modelling human behaviour, agents are endowed with needs and motives that drive their behaviour and ultimately lead to the commission of crime. As the model uses real-world environmental data, it can be used to make predictions in existing cities. The paper demonstrates that use of this framework, in combination with an agent-based model, can replicate patterns and trends that are supported by the current theoretical understanding of offending behaviour.", "language": "en", "ISSN": "0037-5497, 1741-3133", "date": "01/2012", "pages": "50-71", "DOI": "10.1177/0037549710384124", "url": "http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0037549710384124", "title": "Implementing comprehensive offender behaviour in a realistic agent-based model of burglary", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:40:58Z"}, {"key": "FSQCUA9Q", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Gregory Todd", "lastName": "Jones", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "American Journal of Public Health", "journalAbbreviation": "Am J Public Health", "volume": "97", "issue": "5", "language": "en", "ISSN": "0090-0036, 1541-0048", "date": "05/2007", "pages": "780-781", "DOI": "10.2105/AJPH.2006.109058", "url": "https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2006.109058", "title": "AGENT-BASED MODELING: USE WITH NECESSARY CAUTION", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:41:09Z", "shortTitle": "AGENT-BASED MODELING"}, {"key": "P84HQYS9", "version": 0, "itemType": "conferencePaper", "creators": [{"firstName": "George", "lastName": "Mudrak", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Sudhanshu Kumar", "lastName": "Semwal", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "proceedingsTitle": "2012 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS)", "place": "Denver, CO, USA", "conferenceName": "2012 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS)", "ISBN": "9781467313827 9781467313810 9781467313803", "publisher": "IEEE", "date": "05/2012", "pages": "91-96", "DOI": "10.1109/CTS.2012.6261033", "url": "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6261033/", "title": "AgentCity-An agent-based modeling approach to city planning and population dynamics", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-17T17:41:12Z"}, {"key": "JUPTUS63", "version": 0, "itemType": "bookSection", "creators": [{"firstName": "Francesco C.", "lastName": "Billari", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Thomas", "lastName": "Fent", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Alexia", "lastName": "Prskawetz", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "J\u00fcrgen", "lastName": "Scheffran", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Francesco C.", "lastName": "Billari", "creatorType": "editor"}, {"firstName": "Thomas", "lastName": "Fent", "creatorType": "editor"}, {"firstName": "Alexia", "lastName": "Prskawetz", "creatorType": "editor"}, {"firstName": "J\u00fcrgen", "lastName": "Scheffran", "creatorType": "editor"}], "tags": [{"tag": "Assortative Mating", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Representative Agent", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Complex Adaptive System", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Heterogeneous Agent", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Mainstream Economic", "type": 1}], "date": "2006", "title": "Agent-Based Computational Modelling: An Introduction", "pages": "1-16", "publisher": "Physica-Verlag HD", "abstractNote": "Agent-based models (ABMs) are increasingly used in studying complex adaptive systems.

The a priori assumption that employee whistleblowing is always beneficial is, however, rarely examined. While recent research has begun to consider how the complex nature of healthcare institutions impact speaking-up rates, few have investigated the institutional processes and factors that facilitate or retard the benefits of speaking up.

Using an agent-based model, we explore one of the technology-based strategies proposed, a contact-tracing smartphone app. The model simulates the spread of COVID-19 in a population of agents on an urban scale. Agents are heterogeneous in their characteristics and are linked in a multi-layered network representing the social structure\u2014including households, friendships, employment and schools. We explore the interplay of various adoption rates of the contact-tracing app, different levels of testing capacity, and behavioural factors to assess the impact on the epidemic. Results suggest that a contact tracing app can contribute substantially to reducing infection rates in the population when accompanied by a sufficient testing capacity or when the testing policy prioritises symptomatic cases. As user rate increases, prevalence of infection decreases. With that, when symptomatic cases are not prioritised for testing, a high rate of app users can generate an extensive increase in the demand for testing, which, if not met with adequate supply, may render the app counterproductive.

It begins by outlining the meaning and rationale for agent-based models/modelling (ABM), focusing on their history, how they evolved and how they sit within the broader context of modelling and simulation for geographical systems. Three themes which we see essential to ABM are then outlined, namely the question of detail versus model and data parsimony of which ABM represents the former, questions of model validation that flow from this, and lastly issues about the extent to which ABM is a generic or specific style in terms of applications.

One of the main challenges of this method is identifying and describing the main agents. In this study, three main approaches including Genetic Algorithm (GA), cooperative game theory and ABM have been used to optimize water allocation in Tajan catchment. The proposed ABM is a new equation for calculating stakeholder utility and simulating their interactions that can create a hydrological-environmental-human relationship for demand management and optimal water allocation. The results showed that the total benefit of cooperative game theory and ABM relative to GA has been increased 24% and 21% respectively.

Machine learning (ML) is increasingly used to analyze and potentially classify or predict the behavior of biological systems based on such characterization. As ML applications are extremely data-intensive, given the relative sparsity of biomedical data sets ML training of artificial neural networks (ANNs) often require the use of synthetic training data. Agent-based models (ABMs) that incorporate known biological mechanisms and their associated stochastic properties are a potential means of generating synthetic data. Herein we present an example of ML used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) as a surrogate system used to predict the time evolution of an ABM focusing on the clinical condition of sepsis.Methods: The disease trajectories for clinical sepsis, in terms of temporal cytokine and phenotypic dynamics, can be interpreted as a random dynamical system. The Innate Immune Response Agent-based Model (IIRABM) is a well-established model that utilizes known cellular and molecular rules to simulate disease trajectories corresponding to clinical sepsis. We have utilized two distinct neural network architectures, Long Short-Term Memory and Multi-Layer Perceptron, to take a time sequence of five measurements of eleven IIRABM simulated serum cytokine concentrations as input and to return both the future cytokine trajectories as well as an aggregate metric representing the patient\u2019s state of health.Results: The ANNs predicted model trajectories with the expected amount of error, due to stochasticity in the simulation, and recognizing that the mapping from a specific cytokine profile to a state-of-health is not unique. The Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network, generated predictions with a more accurate forecasted trajectory cone.Discussion: This work serves as a proof-of-concept for the use of ANNs to predict disease progression in sepsis as represented by an ABM. The findings demonstrate that multicellular systems with intrinsic stochasticity can be approximated with an ANN, but that forecasting a specific trajectory of the system requires sequential updating of the system state to provide a rolling forecast horizon.", "date": "2021", "publicationTitle": "Frontiers in Physiology", "libraryCatalog": "Frontiers", "accessDate": "2023-09-20T17:12:27Z", "shortTitle": "The Use of Artificial Neural Networks to Forecast the Behavior of Agent-Based Models of Pathophysiology"}, {"key": "7GTQTJVU", "version": 0, "itemType": "conferencePaper", "creators": [{"firstName": "Charles M.", "lastName": "Macal", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Michael J.", "lastName": "North", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "title": "Agent-based modeling and simulation: introductory tutorial", "proceedingsTitle": "Proceedings of the 2013 Winter Simulation Conference: Simulation: Making Decisions in a Complex World", "series": "WSC '13", "publisher": "IEEE Press", "pages": "362\u2013376", "place": "Washington, D.C.", "abstractNote": "Agent-based simulation (ABS) is an approach to modeling systems comprised of individual, autonomous, interacting \"agents.\" Agent-based modeling offers ways to more easily model individual behaviors and how behaviors affect others in ways that have not been available before.

This brief tutorial introduces agent-based modeling and simulation by describing the basic ideas of ABS, discussing some applications, and addressing methods for developing agent-based models.", "ISBN": "9781479920778", "date": "December 8, 2013", "accessDate": "2023-09-20", "libraryCatalog": "ACM Digital Library", "shortTitle": "Agent-based modeling and simulation"}, {"key": "FMU6I5WG", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Amy L.", "lastName": "Bauer", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Catherine A.A.", "lastName": "Beauchemin", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Alan S.", "lastName": "Perelson", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Information Sciences", "journalAbbreviation": "Information Sciences", "volume": "179", "issue": "10", "language": "en", "ISSN": "00200255", "date": "2009-04-29", "pages": "1379-1389", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ins.2008.11.012", "url": "https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020025508004726", "title": "Agent-based modeling of host\u2013pathogen systems: The successes and challenges", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-20T17:12:38Z", "shortTitle": "Agent-based modeling of host\u2013pathogen systems"}, {"key": "QHGQW4D2", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Carlos F.", "lastName": "Mena", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Stephen J.", "lastName": "Walsh", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Brian G.", "lastName": "Frizzelle", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Yao", "lastName": "Xiaozheng", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "George P.", "lastName": "Malanson", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Applied Geography", "journalAbbreviation": "Applied Geography", "volume": "31", "issue": "1", "language": "en", "ISSN": "01436228", "date": "1/2011", "pages": "210-222", "DOI": "10.1016/j.apgeog.2010.04.005", "url": "https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0143622810000512", "title": "Land use change on household farms in the Ecuadorian Amazon: Design and implementation of an agent-based model", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-20T17:12:44Z", "shortTitle": "Land use change on household farms in the Ecuadorian Amazon"}, {"key": "35X7B4BA", "version": 0, "itemType": "bookSection", "creators": [{"firstName": "Ernest", "lastName": "Teniente", "creatorType": "editor"}, {"firstName": "Matthias", "lastName": "Weidlich", "creatorType": "editor"}, {"firstName": "Emilio", "lastName": "Sulis", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Antonio", "lastName": "Di Leva", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "bookTitle": "Business Process Management Workshops", "place": "Cham", "ISBN": "9783319740294 9783319740300", "publisher": "Springer International Publishing", "volume": "308", "date": "2018", "pages": "124-132", "extra": "DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-74030-0_8", "url": "http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-74030-0_8", "title": "An Agent-Based Model of a Business Process: The Use Case of a Hospital Emergency Department", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-20T17:12:53Z", "shortTitle": "An Agent-Based Model of a Business Process"}, {"key": "W5R7JNZN", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Petr\u00f4nio C.L.", "lastName": "Silva", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Paulo V.C.", "lastName": "Batista", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "H\u00e9lder S.", "lastName": "Lima", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Marcos A.", "lastName": "Alves", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Frederico G.", "lastName": "Guimar\u00e3es", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Rodrigo C.P.", "lastName": "Silva", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Chaos, Solitons & Fractals", "journalAbbreviation": "Chaos, Solitons & Fractals", "volume": "139", "language": "en", "ISSN": "09600779", "date": "10/2020", "pages": "110088", "DOI": "10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110088", "url": "https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960077920304859", "title": "COVID-ABS: An agent-based model of COVID-19 epidemic to simulate health and economic effects of social distancing interventions", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-20T17:13:04Z", "shortTitle": "COVID-ABS"}, {"key": "SW7I949E", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Maria", "lastName": "Haensel", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Thomas M.", "lastName": "Schmitt", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Jakob", "lastName": "Bogenreuther", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Journal of Science Education and Technology", "journalAbbreviation": "J Sci Educ Technol", "abstractNote": "Abstract\r\n            Agent-based modeling is a promising tool for familiarizing students with complex systems as well as programming skills. Human\u2013environment systems, for instance, entail complex interdependencies that need to be considered when modeling these systems. This complexity is often neglected in teaching modeling approaches. For a heterogeneous group of master\u2019s students at a German university, we pre-built an agent-based model. In class, this was used to teach modeling impacts of land use policies and markets on ecosystem services. As part of the course, the students had to perform small research projects with the model in groups of two. This study aims to evaluate how well students could deal with the complexity involved in the model based on their group work outcomes. Chosen indicators were, e.g., the appropriateness of their research goals, the suitability of the methods applied, and how well they acknowledged the limitations. Our study results revealed that teaching complex systems does not need to be done with too simplistic models. Most students, even with little background in modeling and programming, were able to deal with the complex model setup, conduct small research projects, and have a thoughtful discussion on the limitations involved. With adequate theoretical input during lectures, we recommend using models that do not hide the complexity of the systems but foster a realistic simplification of the interactions.", "language": "en", "ISSN": "1059-0145, 1573-1839", "date": "2023-01-16", "DOI": "10.1007/s10956-022-10022-z", "url": "https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10956-022-10022-z", "title": "Teaching the Modeling of Human\u2013Environment Systems: Acknowledging Complexity with an Agent-Based Model", "libraryCatalog": "DOI.org (Crossref)", "accessDate": "2023-09-20T17:13:08Z", "shortTitle": "Teaching the Modeling of Human\u2013Environment Systems"}, {"key": "C8EUZYMR", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Eric", "lastName": "Bonabeau", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "publicationTitle": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "journalAbbreviation": "Proc.

Banks are represented as agents who exchange payment requests, which are settled according to a set of simple rules. The model features the main elements of a real-life system, including a central bank acting as liquidity provider, and a simplified money market. A simulation exercise using synthetic data of BI-REL (the Italian RTGS) predicts the macroscopic impact of a disruptive event on the flow of interbank payments. The main advantage of agent-based modeling is that we can dynamically see what happens to the major variables involved. In our reduced-scale system, three hypothetical distinct phases emerge after the disruptive event: 1) a liquidity sink effect is generated and the participants' liquidity expectations turn out to be excessive; 2) an illusory thickening of the money market follows, along with increased payment delays; and, finally 3) defaulted obligations dramatically rise. The banks cannot staunch the losses accruing on defaults, even after they become fully aware of the critical event, and a scenario emerges in which it might be necessary for the central bank to step in as liquidity provider. The methodology presented differs from traditional payment systems simulations featuring deterministic streams of payments dealt with in a centralized manner with static behavior on the part of banks.

The model was validated with the historical data of 2020.

Given the multiscale nature of biological systems, the integration of phenomena at different spatial and temporal scales has emerged to be essential in capturing mechanobiological mechanisms underlying vascular adaptation processes. In this regard, agent-based models have demonstrated to successfully embed the systems biology principles and capture the emergent behavior of cellular systems under different pathophysiological conditions. Furthermore, through their modular structure, agent-based models are suitable to be integrated with continuum-based models within a multiscale framework that can link the molecular pathways to the cell and tissue levels. This can allow improving existing therapies and/or developing new therapeutic strategies. The present review examines the multiscale computational frameworks of vascular adaptation with an emphasis on the integration of agent-based approaches with continuum models to describe vascular pathophysiology in a systems biology perspective. The state-of-the-art highlights the current gaps and limitations in the field, thus shedding light on new areas to be explored that may become the future research focus. The inclusion of molecular intracellular pathways (e.g., genomics or proteomics) within the multiscale agent-based modeling frameworks will certainly provide a great contribution to the promising personalized medicine.

On the basis of the agent-based availability modeling theory, the availability simulation scheme of CMUS is given using MATLAB. Thus, the availability modeling theory of CMUS and its simulation method are developed. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed availability modeling method, a numerical example is given. Findings The proposed agent-based modeling method is applicable to availability modeling of CMUS, including the modeling of component failure, maintenance tools/fields/staff, maintenance policy, and structural/economic dependence among components. Practical implications As a bottom-top, modular, expandable, and reusable modeling theory, the agent-based modeling method might be useful for availability modeling of different CMUSs in reality.

Individually-targeted prevention and treatment strategies targeting individuals have been disappointing, leading some to propose leveraging social networks to improve interventions. We hypothesized that social network dynamics (social marginalization; homophily on body mass index, BMI) and the strength of peer influence would increase or decrease the proportion of network member (agents) becoming overweight over a simulated year, and that peer influence would operate differently in social networks with greater overweight. We built an agent-based model (ABM) using results from R-SIENA. ABMs allow for the exploration of potential interventions using simulated agents. Initial model specifications were drawn from Wave 1 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). We focused on a single saturation school with complete network and BMI data over two waves (n=624). The model was validated against empirical observations at Wave 2. We focused on overall overweight prevalence after a simulated year. Five experiments were conducted: (1) changing attractiveness of high-BMI agents; (2) changing homophily on BMI; (3) changing the strength of peer influence; (4) shifting the overall BMI distribution; and (5) targeting dietary interventions to highly connected individuals. Increasing peer influence showed a dramatic decrease in the prevalence of overweight; making peer influence negative (ie, doing the opposite of friends) increased overweight. However, the effect of peer influence varied based on the underlying distribution of BMI; when BMI was increased overall, stronger peer influence increased proportion of overweight. Other interventions, including targeted dieting, had little impact. Peer influence may be a viable target in overweight interventions, but the distribution of body size in the population needs to be taken into account. In low-obesity populations, strengthening peer influence may be a useful strategy.", "DOI": "10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.05.049", "extra": "PMID: 24951404\nPMCID: PMC4306600", "title": "Leveraging social influence to address overweight and obesity using agent-based models: the role of adolescent social networks", "volume": "125", "pages": "203-213", "date": "2015-1", "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4306600/", "libraryCatalog": "PubMed Central", "accessDate": "2023-10-04T15:04:22Z", "shortTitle": "Leveraging social influence to address overweight and obesity using agent-based models"}, {"key": "GQK2TFSZ", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Lingqiang", "lastName": "Kong", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Guangjin", "lastName": "Tian", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Bingran", "lastName": "Ma", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Xiaojuan", "lastName": "Liu", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [{"tag": "New satellite town", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Ecological sensitivity", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Multi-agent system", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Cellular automata", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Beijing", "type": 1}], "pages": "233-249", "date": "2017-11-01", "ISSN": "1470-160X", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.07.009", "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X17304223", "abstractNote": "As the national center for politics and culture, Beijing\u2019s urbanization level is very high. Many policies within the proposed Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei region coordinated development plan affect the expansion of urban land. Therefore, it is very important to predict urban land use changes in Beijing for planning and management purposes. In this paper, we integrated of MAS (multi-agent system) and CA (cellular automata) to simulate new satellite towns construction and ecological sensitivity impact on land use change. Physical and social driving factors were used in the combined model. The MAS involved the actions of three types of agent: regional authorities, property developers, and residents. The study used the CA model to simulate the neighborhood effects of urban land use, and the MAS model to simulate agents\u2019 decisions. The new satellite towns and an ecological sensitivity analysis were embedded in the model to simulate the impact of decision making by the Beijing government on urban land expansion. Based on the land use data of 2005, the urban land area in 2010, 2015, 2020, and 2025 was predicted using the CA-MAS model. Urban expansion occurred faster during 2015\u20132025 than during the previous 10 years. Three land use types, i.e., cropland, woodland, and rural residential land, were the major sources of urban expansion. With respect to government decision making, the satellite towns were the priority areas of urban development, and urban development was restricted in ecologically sensitive areas. The New Districts of Urban Development were projected to become the main areas of future urban expansion in Beijing.

However, there are several challenges that the agent-based modeling community face. These relate to developing accurate measurements, minimizing a large complex parameter space and developing parsimonious yet accurate models. Machine Learning (ML), specifically deep reinforcement learning has the potential to generate new ways to explore complex models, which can enhance traditional computational paradigms such as agent-based modeling. Recently, ML algorithms have proved an important contribution to the determination of semi-optimal agent behavior strategies in complex environments. What is less clear is how these advances can be used to enhance existing ABMs. This paper presents Learning-based Actor-Interpreter State Representation (LAISR), a research effort that is designed to bridge ML agents with more traditional ABMs in order to generate semi-optimal multi-agent learning strategies. The resultant model, explored within a tactical game scenario, lies at the intersection of human and automated model design. The model can be decomposed into a format that automates aspects of the agent creation process, producing a resultant agent that creates its own optimal strategy and is interpretable to the designer. Our paper, therefore, acts as a bridge between traditional agent-based modeling and machine learning practices, designed purposefully to enhance the inclusion of ML-based agents in the agent-based modeling community.", "ISBN": "9783030612559", "place": "Cham", "proceedingsTitle": "Social, Cultural, and Behavioral Modeling", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-030-61255-9_15", "language": "en", "series": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science", "libraryCatalog": "Springer Link"}, {"key": "XNQM48I9", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "R.", "lastName": "Zupko", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "M.", "lastName": "Rouleau", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [{"tag": "Agent-based modeling", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Policy modeling", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Forest modeling", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Environmental impacts", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Land-use change", "type": 1}], "pages": "117-125", "date": "2019-01-01", "ISSN": "2352-7110", "DOI": "10.1016/j.softx.2019.01.008", "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711018302310", "abstractNote": "This paper describes ForestSim, an agent-based modeling (ABM) platform for forest management policy experimentation and bioenergy sustainability assessment.

Thus, in silico experiments present an excellent alternative for studying such systems. In consideration of these issues, we have developed a user-friendly agent-based model, GutLogo, that captures the spatial and temporal development of four representative bacterial genera populations in the ileum. We demonstrate the utility of this model by simulating population responses to perturbations in flow rate, nutrition, and probiotics. While our model predicts distinct changes in population levels due to these perturbations, most of the simulations suggest that the gut populations will return to their original steady states once the disturbance is removed.

Technology adoption in low-income regions is among the key challenges facing international development projects. Nearly 40% of the world\u2019s population relies on open fires and rudimentary cooking devices exacerbating health outcomes, deforestation, and climatic impacts of inefficient biomass burning. Clean technology alternatives such as clean cookstoves are among the most challenging technologies to approach their target goals through sustainable adoption due to lack of systematic market-driven design for adoption. Thus, a method is needed to provide insight regarding how target customers evaluate and perceive causes for adopting a clean technology. The holistic approach of this study captures the three main aspects of technology adoption through lenses of social networks, individual and society scale beliefs, and rational decision-making behavior. Based on data collected in the Apac region in Northern Uganda, an Agent-Based Model is developed to simulate emerging adoption behavior in a community. Then, four different scenarios investigate how adoption patterns change due to potential changes in technology or intervention strategy. These scenarios include influence of stove malfunctions, price elasticity, information campaigns, and strength of social network. Results suggest that higher adoption rates are achievable if designed technologies are more durable, information campaigns provide realistic expectations for users, policy makers and education programs work toward women\u2019s empowerment, and communal social ties are recognized for influence maximization. Application of this study provides insight for technology designers, project implementers, and policy makers to update their practices for achieving sustainable and to the scale clean technology adoption rates.", "date": "2019/11/25", "conferenceName": "ASME 2019 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference", "publisher": "American Society of Mechanical Engineers Digital Collection", "language": "en", "libraryCatalog": "asmedigitalcollection.asme.org", "accessDate": "2023-10-11T14:59:55Z"}, {"key": "GIHGMVQH", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Dino", "lastName": "Carpentras", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Adrian", "lastName": "Lueders", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Paul J.", "lastName": "Maher", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Caoimhe", "lastName": "O'Reilly", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Michael", "lastName": "Quayle", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [], "title": "How Polarization Extends to New Topics: An Agent-Based Model Derived from Experimental Data", "publicationTitle": "Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation", "journalAbbreviation": "JASSS", "ISSN": "1460-7425", "date": "2023", "volume": "26", "issue": "3", "pages": "2", "shortTitle": "How Polarization Extends to New Topics"}, {"key": "P8S7INIB", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Danhui", "lastName": "Li", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Jia", "lastName": "Yang", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Jin", "lastName": "Li", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Ning", "lastName": "Zhao", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Wensheng", "lastName": "Ju", "creatorType": "author"}, {"firstName": "Moning", "lastName": "Guo", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [{"tag": "Differentiated medical service prices", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Simulation model", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Behavior of seeking medical services", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Simulation experiment", "type": 1}], "date": "2023-08-30", "title": "Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS)on the influence of adjusting medical service fees on patients' choice of medical treatment", "pages": "928", "abstractNote": "We explored the impact of medical service fee adjustments on the choice of medical treatment for hypertensive patients in Beijing.

It is involved in the digestion and protects the host against external pathogens. Examination of the intestinal microbiome interactions is required for understanding of the community influence on host health. Studies of the microbiome can provide insight on methods of improving health, including specific clinical procedures for individual microbial community composition modification and microbiota correction by colonizing with new bacterial species or dietary changes. Methodology/Principal Findings In this work we report an agent-based model of interactions between two bacterial species and between species and the gut. The model is based on reactions describing bacterial fermentation of polysaccharides to acetate and propionate and fermentation of acetate to butyrate. Antibiotic treatment was chosen as disturbance factor and used to investigate stability of the system. System recovery after antibiotic treatment was analyzed as dependence on quantity of feedback interactions inside the community, therapy duration and amount of antibiotics. Bacterial species are known to mutate and acquire resistance to the antibiotics. The ability to mutate was considered to be a stochastic process, under this suggestion ratio of sensitive to resistant bacteria was calculated during antibiotic therapy and recovery. Conclusion/Significance The model confirms a hypothesis of feedbacks mechanisms necessity for providing functionality and stability of the system after disturbance. High fraction of bacterial community was shown to mutate during antibiotic treatment, though sensitive strains could become dominating after recovery. The recovery of sensitive strains is explained by fitness cost of the resistance. The model demonstrates not only quantitative dynamics of bacterial species, but also gives an ability to observe the emergent spatial structure and its alteration, depending on various feedback mechanisms. Visual version of the model shows that spatial structure is a key factor, which helps bacteria to survive and to adapt to changed environmental conditions.", "date": "Feb 19, 2016", "publicationTitle": "PLOS ONE", "journalAbbreviation": "PLOS ONE", "volume": "11", "issue": "2", "pages": "e0148386", "ISSN": "1932-6203", "language": "en", "libraryCatalog": "PLoS Journals", "accessDate": "2023-10-11T15:06:00Z"}, {"key": "UZQY6D5P", "version": 0, "itemType": "journalArticle", "creators": [{"firstName": "Michael P.", "lastName": "Wellman", "creatorType": "author"}], "tags": [{"tag": "Agent-based modeling", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Multiagent systems", "type": 1}, {"tag": "Empirical game-theoretic analysis", "type": 1}], "date": "2016-11-01", "title": "Putting the agent in agent-based modeling", "pages": "1175-1189", "abstractNote": "One of the perquisites of a talk like this is that I get to expound on broad themes.

However, the values of the parameters that underlie the interactions between agents are typically poorly known, and hence they need to be inferred from macroscopic observations of the system. Since statistical inference rests on repeated simulations to sample the parameter space, the high computational expense of these simulations can become a stumbling block. In this paper, we compare two ways to mitigate this issue in a Bayesian setting through the use of machine learning methods: One approach is to construct lightweight surrogate models to substitute the simulations used in inference. Alternatively, one might altogether circumvent the need for Bayesian sampling schemes and directly estimate the posterior distribution. We focus on stochastic simulations that track autonomous agents and present two case studies: tumour growths and the spread of infectious diseases. We demonstrate that good accuracy in inference can be achieved with a relatively small number of simulations, making our machine learning approaches orders of magnitude faster than classical simulation-based methods that rely on sampling the parameter space. However, we find that while some methods generally produce more robust results than others, no algorithm offers a one-size-fits-all solution when attempting to infer model parameters from observations. Instead, one must choose the inference technique with the specific real-world application in mind. The stochastic nature of the considered real-world phenomena poses an additional challenge that can become insurmountable for some approaches. Overall, we find machine learning approaches that create direct inference machines to be promising for real-world applications. We present our findings as general guidelines for modelling practitioners.", "date": "Oct 5, 2022", "publicationTitle": "PLOS Computational Biology", "journalAbbreviation": "PLOS Computational Biology", "volume": "18", "issue": "10", "pages": "e1009508", "ISSN": "1553-7358", "language": "en", "libraryCatalog": "PLoS Journals", "accessDate": "2023-10-11T15:10:04Z"}]
